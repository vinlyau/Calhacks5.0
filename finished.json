S. aircraft will go into this very contested airspace there's no reason that would by doing that that would increase either an attack capability or the fact that we want to try to that United States or the allies want to try to achieve on the now that can be achieved from a standoff capability it you know it it's amazing scene and has been reporting that messages are being passed or have been passed to Moscow about the US and allies intentions to create a lasting deterrent against the use of chemical weapons I'm in what level of information with the U. S. pass along to Russia in advance of the strike like this obviously a great concern to to a general Mattis and others has been you know a direct confrontation between the U. S. right US forces and Russian forces in Sir correct Anderson this is this is the challenges the visualization and we get to these are locations where Syrian aircraft and other capabilities are for example here's the capital of Damascus where we already know attacks are on doing what we see here and read or locations where Russian forces not just aircraft but ground forces logistics capabilities intelligence capabilities to include ground capabilities coexist with Syrian forces the challenges if if chemical capabilities are in any of these locations you now have a very precise requirement to ensure collateral damage can be determined not only for civilians but you will have to increase the the requirement to ensure that you have stand off and separation between Russian targets because we are not targeting the Russians but if we were to have an accidental engagement with the Russians that would immediately because escalation that's what's driving the secretary of defense's caution his primary thing is to present to the present United States a solution and he did that is punitive that takes capabilities that Assad has primarily his chemical capabilities commanded control inventory research and development delivery means off the table they have to be degraded but what has to happen simultaneously as we can't afford to go after Russian targets yeah because we that that just would put us into a level of escalation that we can't have", '4At-bRt5KTg': u"statements American tax rules the world yes it does but not in the Gee whiz field all the quantum computing which I belly on this I don't understand it period and so who better the spell it out for me and explain the Michio kaku physics professor extraordinaire and the author of that book the future of humanity professor welcome to the program led to be on the show again just treat me as a common or garden idiot please explain what is quantum computing well remember when we were kids they were vacuum tubes televisions and vacuum tube radio number those dates remain well then we went to silicon and everything changed Silicon Valley got off the ground all of a sudden trillion dollar corporation guy started we could be witnessing the next transition from transistors based on silicon transistors based on Adams so the Pentagon already is raising alarm bells saying there's gonna be a quantum gap like the missile gap of the nineteen sixties it is just a quantum computing is just a manipulation of individual atoms that's it that's right in other ways silicon like for example in your Pentium chip has a layer about twenty items across that's how small transistors are getting however in the next decade or so Moore's law will slow down computer power will level off and we're going to go to the next transition which could be molecular computers optical computers or quantum computers we're going to enter the post silicon era like today we are in the post a vacuum tube era we're gonna be the post silicon era in other words Silicon Valley could become a rust belt so your implying and and I think the premise of your appearance today is that China is ahead of us in quantum computer that's right however we shouldn't hyper ventilate the actual creation of a successful quanta computer which could crack any code on the planet earth any nations code can be crack like that we're still decades of way from that from that goal so we shouldn't think that almost that everything's gonna collapse because of this but American companies are involved in quantum computer everybody's involve Microsoft Google on all of them are rushing in to learn the quantum mechanics of Adams because we're gonna be computing on individual atoms individual atoms in a magnetic field can be either up or down or sideways or in between so instead of zeros and ones there is a wind you can have anything in between zeros and one not think about that anything in between zero and one you can compute with why that would make an ordinary silicon computer look obsolete like a model T. can you find the password for my jeep I'm I'm in trouble computer will break any password any code this is why the CIA and the NSA have had study groups we know this because a quick these documents have been league fifth I was that the CIA and the NSA have looked into it and they say that it's still decades away however we got to get into it now before other nations get their first some show we will cause the shoulder profit involved professor thank you so much for joining us and I I think I understand why mode not thank you professor

amazing Ilan mosque is made such a side job himself that people start to forget about including myself the underlying business and all the headlines about must does this must does that and then you start reading about the car so once I I scrape that passes a short seller I'm always rechecking my thesis and up to a few weeks ago I was short and I'm re check in that I'm like oh my god this car is just dominating and the model S. is still dominating not just dominating there's completely smoking the competition and I'm like well can they make money so I started to read more and go more deeper and deeper and I realized that for these all these years I I could really I didn't really understand the tassel stories I'm understanding it more no not this over test level and I know there's still a lot of factors in execution is still there right but I think being short going into this quarter knowing that he just made earnings a week earlier right on top of Ford's earnings and know that the company finally hitting stride with production of the model three and I see the short interest I'm like oh no that's just wrong yeah I'm not in the short interest in what is still elevated so you think the October twenty fourth new date for earnings as a positive sign I want to know about when we go into the capital needs for has that because a lot of war is that always they need to raise more money might have to level out supplied to the equity out that you know what about that anymore I mean the lower about what like twenty six hours twenty seven hours is see a much if they generate free cash flow musk said you know for years of doubt it must got when I heard the word giga factory I laughed there's so many different things that Tessa said there was good they were going to do and I laughed so sure enough I mean I think the guy the quickest settlement ever with the SEC he actually got the FTC to work on a Saturday so when he said they're going to be cash flow positive possibly this quarter I'm not going to doubt it I'll wait and see it so I mean here's the thing we need to put a tussle in the context of the bigger automotive picture in demand as well auto sales as a whole has plateaued they peaked in September twenty seventeen at an annualized rate of eighteen point four seven million would test would be subject to the same industry headwinds cyclical headwinds Mason part about it that that that's what really surprised me Natalie's Tesla eating from BMW Mercedes and allergy but they're also eating from Toyota and Honda people actually pay more money to drive a tassel it's just it's the it's a revolution that I actually under estimated the way people are buying these cars so the number that you're talking about a hundred percent true for other automakers not for Tesla it is what it is wave that for does a price target go for you in times of you've got out that some you run some social here's this where it gets tricky because the real question that I always has a short sellers at the end of the it's a car company what we're basing those estimates profit on old school manufacturing so the more you read the more you see that you know bike by not sourcing as many parts by not having as many parts doing away with the dealer networks in unions where does this model take you and you don't know and me tomorrow an associate that Detroit one of the leading auto industry experts said they could do over thirty percent gross margins on the model three I'm sure they'll do more those on the on a cross over so we don't know and and that's where it's it's become a black box I'm not even looking at the shared mobility or or solar city let's call that call options I I put a a sensitivity analysis in the story I just selling cars globally now I wanted to get to a pot socks as well away was for that sorry yeah he won't last question under because you write in your notes that you'll still pursuing at will to suit in a mosque over the price target that they put out for twenty that tweet you lost money in the fact that they use it overruled by putting out not to be that they would hit that set a price point what that for a you still sticking my why you still wanting to see we go on the it is it is it is business on that particular day I was short the stock he said funding secured funding wasn't secured I want my money back that's it that has nothing to do with my position on the stock today right has nothing to do with your outlook on tests of the company either at this but I don't think all of the stock of the eight hundred two hundred that lawsuit lives within itself is that I don't particular day all right so self contained let's move on to the self contained world a marijuana stocks are perhaps not that you were shorting Kronos and till ray have you close your shorts or is there some more downside to come here there's no more downside to calm me possibly you know if somebody wanted to buy you know if you want to put your foot in right here by some canopy they'll be the leader in the space but yet still rate just of a low flow story I think Kronos is not going to deliver for rack for for their investors the longer story and I was also short you know some other smaller names in Canada it fell apart a lot faster than I thought I mean I knew the cell the news event I don't know was within three or four days an under I mean interestingly though we still see companies coming up to the U. S. to get some more investor base you just seen a rule or list on the New York Stock Exchange as well as I bring Canada could do added volume the them the more stocks to be able to get involved in a slow drain out the appetite for the market I mean there's a difference between added vitamin hysteria so what we saw over the past few months which is pure hysteria was completely removed from all fundamentals and you know maybe it'll come in more and eat so it would be great if the stocks to become investable let's let them put out a few quarters if you don't be such a rush if you believe their longstanding businesses that are building you know real businesses that will stand the test of time you can buy it next quarter of the quarter after the let's see how they do", 'U3hUREbpaTY':

through a fire at the moment and then on top of the we've had a couple of very strong earthquakes and Mexico some of this is normal but some of it may also be a harbinger of things to come science can explain all of these earthquakes the frequency of earthquakes is remarkably consistent seven point oh earthquake and also an eight point within two weeks of each other is not unusual at all the fact that they both happened in Mexico is a little unusual but lots of quakes happened in Mexico think about earthquakes is that most of the big earthquakes actually in the world happen in places where there's not a lot of people so they don't really get noticed earthquakes aside it's tricky some of what's been happening is related to climate change some of it isn't that's what fires are an interesting question because there's some element of normality and nature involved but there's a lot of human influence here it's been very dry climate change related and also there's certain insect infestations that are now worse because the climate change that can kill trees and that's fuel for fires couple that with human influences more and more people are living in areas that are close to forest the human desire to live close to nature Sir plays into the whole what's going on here feeling where is you know twenty years ago wild for might have happened somewhere in the Rockies and nobody lived there so nobody really care now the same wildfire that might happen in the same location and there's a cation homes there and so people take notice terms of her kids generally speaking the months of August September and October the busy active part of the season some years you don't get many hurricanes at all it's a naturally variable situation it is probably a little unusual that several of them have been really a monster hurricane and have also have made landfall you want a big database of things study and her cans you know with like twelve or fifteen storms every year that's not a huge number that you're working with but some scientists say the intense is we've had is more likely to repeat itself since you're pretty confident that climate change will make hurricanes worse for two reasons one is warmer air holds more moisture the other impact is that sea levels are rising some point particularly your personally affected by these things the scientific explanations not

made an assumption we would immediately turn to China start negotiating that and that's not happening is not about the opposite of that's happening were escalating with China and that is really going to show up and tools really big items there you've got the potential for a book a real economic war with the number two economy in the world and rising interest rates you say Nancy that the market is recalibrating right now how are you re calibrating your hold yeah well I I see some really attractive valuations are that we're taking a look at we've been adding to some of the consumer discretionary names like X. Amazon so home depot in McDonald's those are both stocks that are negatively correlated to rising and rising energy prices so that's positive for the consumer you kind of would think the opposite but in fact that Emma dollars gets a nice upgrade today stocks the tire yeah yeah and they raise the dividend and they just are very consistent about as is home depot so we were finding places to go but but we're cautious I mean this earnings season is going to be tricky part I kind of jumped in on you there in my own enthusiasm wow how if at all are you recalibrating what your advising or doing which is the only one that we think that one of the most dangerous things that's happening right now you're seeing this move to defensive so over the last week or so you've seen the REITs and utilities in the staples actually catch a bit the resident mom and I think that's the wrong thing to do I think if you want to get defensive you want to move to cash I think getting into those even after that which is right now is getting have yourself and those you to reverse quite quickly when you don't have that natural flow out of market that's that's a danger that the data is part of the trade I think where we see the most value currently I think it's a combination of healthcare for sure energy and we certainly thank you start thinking about technology which is probably the worst performing group we seen in the last month or what is the market if anything telling us Nancy about the economy we're hearing all sorts of you know that calm these are strongly kinds very strong we take a look at what's under the hood in the markets we already saw health care the best performance after the third quarter we see fangs stocks already in correction territory we saw the semiconductors a highly cyclical area the markets in correction territory the average small cap stock according to bespoke is down twenty percent right these are all telling me that growth is really slowing I I mean I think this is this what we're all trying to figure out because you've got a fad that's pushing forward with on it to fight inflation the elusive inflation at least it was a list of for John Allen and then you've got I'm at a market that is growing but we're not sure how fast and what are the input the price the price inputs are going to be an impact and then a strong dollar which is going to hurt the multinational so what we're trying to figure out on a company by company basis is who has the growth and we are overweight in old tak healthcare and and some of the industrial have done quite well like Boeing and we see some of that continuing you know are you listed out in your notes here some of the areas of concern that a trade Cold War add their concerns over slowing growth in China inflation oil prices spiking ten year yield strong U. S. dollar emerging market weakness given all of those factors how can you be bullish on the market that's a great question so I listened you just mentioned I think trade in trade wars and and and how long how big and how long it dries out is the biggest concern we have now I think everything else to a certain extent is going to be transitory for sure the dollar will not continue to be strong for ever when we're not the only central bank that is normalizing when the ECB the bank of Japan start to normalize first quarter of next year fourth quarter of this year receive some less strict when we stop acting so tough on trade were really in the sausage making part of this trade right now deals like you mean when not if where it now I don't know that that happens in two thousand eighteen but when we negotiate we don't want to be a long drag due to drown out mutually destructive trade war but we also want to act tough and in get China to change the behavior but right now watching that happen is like trying to learn how to parallel park in a demolition derby is just not fun and and that's causing inside in the market so final question to both of you earnings are going to start next week basically what are you looking for and and I guess my question is what's more important the the rearward looking numbers or what these companies say prospectively I mean it's the perspective of it for sure and I I do think that what we want to hear I want to hear that the top the top line is still growing and they expect to see the top I'm going I am less concerned about earnings in the near short term than I am about top line growth so that that's what I'm gonna be paying attention to art I think it is right I think the the the two things to be the most concerned about is a how much to talk about the strong dollar and input cost and how much and it's gonna hurt and bring down your guidance going forward I think a second thank this is as important as going to the first quarter the cycle were coming and sitting out support versus bumping up against resistance last to coalesce recorders entering the orders reporting season we're actually inflated sourcing coming in at a much

political pawns in a debate Chicago will not let our residents have the fundamental rights isolated and violated the biggest dream of all is the American dream and Chicago is a place where the American dream is open to all who believe that tomorrow can be a better place for our children I mean now is BGT partner senior strategist and fox news contributor Steve Cortez's here Steve good to hear you are my one lucky guy not number last week so yes not been too long but as a former trump Hispanic Advisory Council member your reaction to the Chicago mayor well you know my reaction when I listen to him he reminds me and I really mean this in this might make some liberals heads explode but he reminds me of George Wallace in the nineteen sixties and other southern governors and mayors who refuse to comply with federal law in the civil rights era why because they had a narrow political agenda of their own and that's what he's doing right here he he also by the way I think this is important I think what mayor Emanuel doing in my home town where I live right raised a family this is the most dangerous city in the developed world and there's no way to didn't even argue that Chicago is in shambles right now the west side of the city is a war zone children cannot play safely in broad daylight they're about to return to failing schools somewhat is Mary manual want to do about that he wants to sue the department of justice he wants to create a day version every tackling lucky don't worry about IT he took it a step further anything we may be the first to do so but we will not be the last will others follow suit right well let me tell you this to Sarah I even hate the term sanctuary cities I call them renegade cities because it's not century for the victims of criminals who are allowed to hide in plain sight look I love immigration I'm the son of an immigrant but if you don't belong here in the first place if you're not a legal immigrant and then on top of that you commit a crime you have to be gone yesterday and that's not sanctuary to say that you're allowed to stay when you are here legally in the first place and on top of it you're dangerous that's called a renegade city Carson Steve I'm just curious because I I hear this a lot this objection to sanctuary cities and that that a lot of police chiefs across the country including some of our major cities say you know we're not trying to be political and they say the ability to you know release detainees back into the community even you know pretty small petty crime help them to build very vital and key relationships in those cities that are able to protect not only citizens but also immigrant communities as well I don't think I agree with that that's just the objection that we hear all the time so can you maybe box that myth for it if it is one or why shouldn't we be listening to these police chief where's the truth there right well first of all it is a myth and by the way there is and there is in the U. S. cold a way if you cooperate with police if you're an illegal immigrant but you cooperate with police in catching somebody who's dangers commits a violent crime there's actually a waiver by which you can become legal so it's a myth that they won't cooperate with the police but here's the other man I think that's more important most of the time the victims of these very people of these dangerous people who are allowed to hide in plain sight are are minorities themselves are generally in this town in Chicago they're not going up too late for us to a wealthy north shore community and causing trouble there causing trouble in a Hispanic neighborhood very often that the victims themselves are Hispanics whether their native born or legal immigrants so I argue there's actually racism in trying to protect them and what's going on here is there's a politically correct liberal madness were mayors like rom Emanuel like build Lazio there in your city of New York City lay in San Francisco and Los Angeles Gil Garcetti or I Eric Garcetti rather where these barriers are pursuing their own narrow agenda and they are they are of standing on their solemn duty to protect first and foremost the safety of the citizens and we talked about it last week and then and the residents of Chicago fleeing that city at a record pace to me while those are still there are getting double triple their property taxes doubled and tripled over recent years artista meanwhile do you can cover Maryland is suburb in Maryland I should say is debating allowing undocumented residents voting right College Park City residents will be able to vote for mayor and city council members illegal immigrants be able to vote in local elections center I didn't know unequivocally no and again to I you know even that turn undocumented I I reject I think it's important that we use the English language correctly I don't like century cities I don't like the term on document because it makes it sound as though the paperwork is simply missing but otherwise they're supposed to be here no they're illegal immigrants if you're at a legal immigrant you're not suppose if you're in my home by the way the mill the night you're not invited you're a burglar you're not an undocumented visitor to my home and so it's important that we use correct terms by the way it's no it's no coincidence that called park Maryland is also the home of the university of Maryland and I think sadly college towns college universities in the college campuses in this country have become really bastions of this kind of absolute nonsense look we're not anti immigrant love immigration but we have the right as a country to determine the process of becoming an American legally and it must be followed and wanted to follow we welcome you as a voter that see the the president made some accusations that there was widespread voter fraud do you see any evidence of that because of what I was the oversight chairman quite frankly I just didn't see it but is there evidence say in Chicago that people that are there illegally are actually registering and voting in in these elections you know I I will say it's a good question I will see there is some evidence it's not widespread I don't believe but I think it should be looked into certainly but there is some evidence in Chicago yes that there are certain precincts where the remote more votes cast than there are people eligible to vote in that precinct so you're more than one hundred percent turn out is so you know but again did decide any elections I don't believe so I don't think it's as widespread as the president at least intimated but is it worth looking into absolutely it is and by the way looking into a business with the left always try to do as though they try to see even looking into it is racist and that's crazy it it's it's very sensible to say let's just have a Frank look at a problem and decide if there is indeed a problem there so I don't think it's widespread I don't use the term elections but it's worth a look", 'By4zuyBqrGE': u"according to to scientific studies tornado activity throughout the US has shifted over the past several decades scientists say tornadoes are decreasing and frequency in traditionally plot prone places like Oklahoma and Kansas but tornado frequency is increasing farther east in more densely populated areas for more on this I want to bring in CBS news contributing meteorologist Jeff Barrett deli Jeff this doesn't sound like it's a great new I mean I guess it's good news for the people that are going to be seeing fewer tornadoes but it doesn't sound like it's great news for people who live in areas that are prepared for it that's exactly right so the shift is happening towards the southeastern United States in the Midwest now the Midwest they're used to tornadoes southeast they also get tornadoes but we seem to be getting a lot more in places like Alabama Mississippi Arkansas places like Missouri so because of these people are less prepared and there's also another problem there is a lot more trees so it's hard to see tornadoes coming and by the way Clements logically speaking tornados tend to happen at night more often in the southeast than they do in the plains states then you got to add to that the the fact that the framed homes not really built for big tornadoes like they are in place like Moore Oklahoma let's say where they get those big EF fours and fives so there's really a a a danger for disaster there in fact they calculate this paper that of the chance for potential disaster goes up by three times all because of the shift to the east I knew corniel alley if you will absolute is very scary for people in that region out what sorts of climate changes are responsible for this so here's what's happening that there's dryer that's been building in the deep south west a persistent drought and not dry your doesn't stay there it kind of starts spreading out so it seems to be pushing the dry line which is typically where these tornadoes and severe weather initiates anybody who from the plains states knows about the dry line one side of it is moist it as Gulf air warm moist air the western side is desert air and all that does it seems to be progressing to the east so we're seeing a movement of what we call the one hundredth meridian or the one hundred longitudinal line basically that means that drivers moving further east to severe weather is moving east and also having an impact on agriculture as well so it's it's really having a big impact right so this east toward shift then I I'm assuming it can you elaborate on how it's affecting agriculture yet so the problem here is it's moved about a hundred and forty miles to the east Columbia University this spring put out a whole article on this and it really causes a problem for farmers because they rely on consistent weather and climate change causes a lot of extremes now we're not a hundred percent sure that what's happening with the tornado story that we just did is due to climate change but the lead researchers I talked to one of them today said it probably is climate change in Columbia University also thinks that it's this man made climate change that's causing this dry line or the one hundredth meridian to move further east and basically what that means for farmers is where you used to be able to plant corn it's harder now you have to plant wheat and there are farmers who are legitimately concerned about their future their lifestyle right now in passing along their farms to their children and by the way to the viability of the towns where these forms exist it's not so easy to transfer your crops like that I mean if you've been planting one crop your whole life it's not so easy to just suddenly up and change it it's true in is that next crop that you plant as profitable right you know what kind of economic impact does it have to the families that run these far and for the communities in the area so we are seeing that shift because a climate change dictates that it's likely to get dryer in the deep south west and because of that that dryer will continue to expand to the east and it's likely also going to because the the frequency of tornadoes to continue to expand to the east so will this eastward expansion mean that the tornadoes will become deadlier because of the region that it's entering it's very possible and again that's because of of a lot of factors is not just because there are more tornadoes in the southeast is because they're harder to see their wrapped in rain because they're they're containing Gulf air ride the plain states you can see tornadoes from dozens of miles away sometimes or at least ten miles away or or so but you know when you're talking about places in the southeast there's a lot of Gulf moisture and a lot of heavy rain and you can't see the tornadoes coming so there's lots of reasons why they're more deadly in the southeast now and Jeff the el Nino forecast was released Thursday by Columbia University explain el Nino to us and what what it tells us about the upcoming winter alright so the premium forecast come from the I. R. I. which is the international research institute at Columbia University they put it out today it's in conjunction with no way as well and basically el Nino is a warming of the surface waters in the Pacific and right now we're on the cusp of what looks to be an el Nino a commuter city says their computer models are predicting about an eighty five ninety percent chance that there will be an el Nino a starting in November probably lasting for about April or so that warmer water kind of changes the air currents in the atmosphere in the jet streams and often times it has a big impact on the United States is considering this is gonna be considered a moderate el Nino most likely means it's gonna be wetter in southern California probably that's the forecast weather in the deep south west through Texas into Florida then maybe up the eastern seaboard here's why that becomes important because once you get to North Carolina and north of that all that cold air sometimes sometimes phases or mixes with all that which we can get some bomb you know big snowstorm along the eastern seaboard actually from New York City so is that what we're expecting then some huge snow storms wherever your early to tell you never know if the timing is going to work out but the ingredients would be there it would be normal it's a normal temperatures expected this winter in places like New York City you also have more moisture kind of creeping up the coast if they can come together you can see some of your biggest snowstorms during el Nino years at the same time though it makes the Pacific Northwest a little bit drier than normal and a little warmer than normal everywhere and like the northern tier states from Washington and Oregon eastward a straight across the Great Lakes yourself what's of impact expected the one that we're looking for New York City is the possibility of a a make a snow storm along the eastern seaboard sometimes it out during all the years sometimes it does not looking forward to it but in terms of temperatures it sounds like they're expected to be pretty temperate you know usually it ends up being just slightly above normal actually so it may be warmer but when that cold air meets that moisture bank you can get a big snow storm a perfect storm Jeff thank you so much for that", 'fGS4-sIMDqo': u"I believe in building a better future for all children which requires offering them a planets that the steel habitable in twenty five years some people think that securing current industries and their jobs is more urgent than transforming our economies to me the global challenge of climate change I hear I hear this concerns but we must find a smooth transition to a low carbon economy because once he's a meaning a phone line ready if we work only destroying the planet one sacrifice finds the future of our children what is the meaning of farm life if all this season all conscious decision is to reduce CO Paulton eighties fall out children or grandchildren by polluting the oceans not mitigating CO two emissions and destroying all bio diversity welcoming all planets latest face it's there is No planet B. owns these you shoot it may happen we have disagreements between the United States and France it may happen I can all families but that's for me shot done is that women's on the wrong well we would have to face the same realities and we're just citizen of the sun planets so we will have to face it cell beyond some short term disagreements we have to work together with business leaders and local communities letters work together in order to make our planet's greater gain and create new jobs and new opportunities once the voting then I'm sure one day the United States would come back and join the Burris agreements and I'm I'm sure we can work together to fulfill with you zombie since all of the global compact on the environment", 'nVyHBxcQovM': u"the hunt for the serial bank robber who has the F.

with any religion have risen from nineteen to twenty eight percent so that a third of Democrats in the USA and I conventional church goers or prayers or anything like that this now Brian Kilmeade traditional guys author the big new history book Thomas Jefferson in the Tripoli pilots pirates I should say the forgotten war the change American issue will get to that man when you read this fall and I'm being unfair because there are spiritual people who just don't align themselves with any any faith and and that's true but there is a growing secularism in the Democratic Party that I think is is is reflected in in their positions you great I do and what I did is when I got this I'm gonna talk to three Democrats today and I said what do you think of this poem we think it is they said number one for most millennials they look at this poll and they for the most part declare themselves Democrats even if they're not think you will cut because they're younger people right younger people do it so would the two issues that matter most pot number one legalize we want to do it same sex marriage it seems to be resonating on campuses him for those who my lean conservative and what is the structure the structures in the church they say yes to they say notable thing so they say yeah I'm spiritual I got my value system but I need to go to the church every Sunday because fundamentally a beginning to disagree and I have a third opinion just my own I see Christians being slaughtered by Muslims I see Shia and Sunni wiping each other out I see the Israelis and Palestinians stabbing and shooting each other I say to myself on twenty two years old look I would be part of that I knew I could blame religious factions for and as part of your history book coming out for violence and it's always happen but what I think it is is that now if it's peer pressure do we did it when I was in college during the Vietnam War I was the only one the chaplain Marist college I would go to messages me when I was a kid he speeded up father it's just me twenty second fashion nobody okay because the trend was secular deserve that and then came back a little bit but the peer pressure now is say if you're Catholic you're an idiot you know if you're a observant Jew what's wrong with you this is what's on the street Mrs what's happening I think it is I think all of that is true the ocean is a big thing and Democratic Party too I think so too and the other thing is a little sisters of the poor conflict and I think when the cardinal Dolan felt as though the rug was pulled out from by the present but I can the exemption obamacare it ends up being the president who represents the next generation and the old school term said I was do Palmer how we decided that if you are a liberal person the secularism is in your wheel house yeah so it's harder to be a affiliate yourself all right now kill me to have big hit with the watches five book right they finished okay on that and this book on the triply pirates this was the first ever marine operation US marines going over to Tripoli Libya all right why they do it a sensually we had no choice we had a warm in seventeen eighty four and the next

best of which are prominent socially says by the Karan's mantra we can actually do what we want you in anyway because you're so the Americans are trying to trade you develop American economy because after the revolution we needed money all right and it could go into the Mediterranean Sea because he's pirates from Tripoli would attack the ships and kidnapped the Americans take all this stuff but we didn't have the capacity to right the wrong right we didn't and Adam said I met these guys unless we want to fight them and I'll paraphrase unless you want to fight him forever with they're not a fighter middle Jefferson said the more we the more we let him go the worse this is going to get Jefferson prove right when Adams finally had a navy thanks to Washington's commission he chose not to fight when Jefferson got that need to be president he said he became president and he said I'm not making the payments the the good they're going to put a war on us and they did and the thing that changed everything around bill Reilly was and we decide to go on the ground starting in Alexandria Virginia bye led by a man named William Eaton and Presley banning of the marines all right from the

for a long time we're going to do that across the government we have taken action to defend the religious conscience of doctors nurses teachers students and groups like the little sisters of the poor in January of this year I was proud to be the first president to stand here in the rose garden to address the March for life very special day in my administration has spoken out against religious persecution around the world including the persecution of many many questions what's going on it's horrible it would take an action we are taking action we condemn all crimes against people of faith and today we are launching another historic action to promote religious freedom I will soon be signing an executive order to create a faith initiative at the White House thank you thank you very much the faith initiative will help design new policies that recognize the vital role of faith in our families our communities and our great country this office will also help insure that faith based organizations have equal access to government funding and the equal right to exercise their deeply held beliefs we take this step because we know that in solving the many many problems that are great challenges faith is more powerful than government and nothing is more powerful than god", 'Hdzr_kUfd5U': u"well there are times admitting it doesn't just understand voters of faith very much the paper's executive editor saying it flat out failed to recognize the role that religion played in getting Mr trump elected I think that the New York based and Washington based to probably media power houses don't quite get religion we don't get religion we don't agree we were we don't get the role of religion in people's lives and I think we can do much much better and I think there are there are things that we can be more creative about to understand the country fox's religion analysts father Jonathan Morris is here with keep in mind next time what you make of what common that's great honestly yeah and I love to hear I can't believe I'm hearing what what what IM here you also said it should be noted that they do have a very good religion reporter Laurie Goodstein I think is a very good job she's very factual on on she's biased against religion but one thing is to be reporting on the backs of religious you know that the religious phenomena right this is what people do another thing is until I understand and god in somebody's life how did it affect this election well you know I think there are a lot of people praying first of all for a good outcome there were I've talked to many people around the country that that they static and I the election holding hands with each other praying that whatever happened was the right thing for the country yes and I think another thing where The New York Times other than for a news organization from the nest at they said oh no religious people certainly campy for this guy Donald Trump because he's done this this and this whereas I think a lot of people say Hey god uses very imperfect instruments all the time and and therefore maybe this is the good best thing for the country even though the instrument is very that's a great one SO an analysis of religion in the New York times is very different than the lived experience of someone in say middle America feels like in a perfect vessel as you said could be the one that delivers America back to them how the recapture that understanding of how a lot of Americans see their fate you have to invest resources and you have to have invest resources not just to go report from as an outsider's point of view but actually have people who might actually believe this crazy thing that ninety percent of Americans believe and that is the existence of god okay reporter and I'm I'm not saying that the reporter does not I'm saying what I'm saying is that the very different and also to have opinions of you know people writing opinions in a New York times who might be those crazy midwesterners as flyover states who believe that god is real and is providential in our lives will or some other people believe that climate change Israel and now the Catholic Church is getting involved in the climate change a controversy new guidelines issued to priest state that the members of the clergy should be promoters of an appropriate care for everything connected to the protection of creation there have to basically promote climate change talk about climate change breaking news Vatican believes in taking care of creation on that goes right back to genesis we're talking about this before one thing is that I might not agree with the pope for with another dish support other priest another Catholic on the specifics of for example the science of global warming I may or may not that's not the issue here the issue is here is that we have to recognize that if the earth is not being taken care of it affects us human beings and especially affects the poor but this goes further I mean this this is it in it he talks about climate change I mean that I want to go to mass and hear about climate change what feels like a political subject I will be taking on a good five minutes in my family to what do you think what I will not that's a question I I I always wrestle with why why is it turned political ones that have to be exactly if if if science tells us that the climate change is affecting people's lives okay I don't I'm not a scientist I don't know exactly how it is or isn't but if it is and it's as if it's a specially affecting the poor of course people of religion and and all of us should be speaking out against what is causing and that's a whole nother question what is causing it whether it's earthquakes or whether it's using aerosol sold bottles I'm not exactly sure pollution from China we do have to take care of the creation as bad over there listen I feel like you would handle it other down the more it's always good to have you thank you very much the

great job at the date just so you know I think ill and I know you do another one soon as all the parts that I would but I like the fact that people paying attention and I think that's a good thing not a bad thing and I think it's very hard to have a date ten people up there I think that one thing alone does make it hard to have have conversation with Detroit I'm I think the way society gets better it's collaboration and thought and analysis we just had a session downstairs about it with the gates foundation bring the plan to pay is making a science what works what doesn't work the radically

Detroit but we need to do makes substantial prize and then she's going to cation you know sixty percent of the kids in inner city high poverty here do not graduate high school and the forty percent do probably not prepared for job and that that's that's the national warm infrastructure planning you think that our city state government of your with the temperature to think it through for a long time ago bridges and roads and tunnels and water plants etcetera and and then obviously fiscal we need to really think through the fiscal policy long term policy for America to pay full of things we're doing and keep the country growing some voters seem to believe tax reform is one of the top issues that need to be on the agenda of the next president of Congress do you think this is important for business right now I mean obviously this is all I hear from Mr I think tax reform if it's done right would help it grow faster it would help all Americans and you know we've we've had this debate there's no corporate tax and individual tax not to help the companies will help individuals we want to do is help the more complete number one comedy well also passed better prices hunter consumers and and so you know I had it and everyone should pay taxes stuff like that but our system is driving kapple overseas right now and I just think that that's a mistake in the damage is permanent so the question is how does it take before we say let's stop this in their does it take to say that American cars have to compete to and I'm not saying individual Shinpei I don't mind paying personal taxes I think by look to enhance the compact credit I think the only thing you can do that can make it better in fear for individuals to but we gotta get you gotta get on this this this can damage we have time for this to really damage the country and you're saying reform taxes and then use money toward infrastructure education the things that if you don't have people the people weren't about to raise taxes and goes into Washington is like the giant sucking sound down there that's a legitimate concern and we we don't waste a lot of money and so you know what I think government have to spend it wisely intelligently thoughtfully not ideologically on things that work like education infrastructure and a number for the tax system and help businesses grow in business a great job there are a hundred and forty three million jobs in America I believe all the twenty million or business you know business she was in the world that's a huge plus and then of course we want to help all Americans do better and but you know that doesn't have to be a binary thing you know the Democrats and Republicans etcetera let's look let's gonna hold handled but maybe for your way to make this all work better well you've said in the past you've been a lifelong Democrat could you ever see yourself voting Republican yeah I've never been a knee jerk anything and and I urge everyone always you know that listen to both sides don't just have that reaction that's no immoral or wrong in it we it's good to have principles but is bad to have ideology which he won't even look at facts or information what works in the real world so you know to me I just want people to work together and get it done and sometimes will disagree but sometimes we should agree do you have a candidate yet no are you hearing different things privately from secretary Hillary Clinton then she's talking about and the population in the populace for example and I quote I will rein in Wall Street I will hold insurance companies to account I will make sure drug prices are affordable do you think she's going to do all that well I look it when you say that commitment shown and I I don't know when I I just reset but what questions to hold people accountable I I believe in holding rain well Hey what is that mean well if if someone with some wrong you should write a midnight group that too so I know I don't know we

for good reason to Americans think president trump is a racist the Associated Press nears university of Chicago took the pollen asked that question fifty seven percent of all American said yes that's of all Americans nearly six in ten Americans think the president is a racist look what happens when you break that down by race forty seven percent of whites nearly half of whites think the president is a racist eighty four percent of African Americans think the president is a racist three quarter of Hispanics believe the president is a racist a say it is just a starting it is a every day we talk about things we never thought we would ever talk about but if you are I would hope if you are the president of the United States and you see those numbers are you would spend a little quiet time put the phone down and not to eat and think about why is it that nearly six in ten citizens of my country think I'm a racist you know I see two things happening in the electoral climate gender gap and Democrats are also heartened by this idea that went in their polling one of the main problems that people are raising about president trump the Republican Party is intolerance but there there is a sense in the country of the party and the president being intolerant clearly reflected in Paul and it's going to play a big role even internal even twenty one percent of Republicans twenty one percent of Republicans say the president is a racist into your point think about that African Americans Latino Americans don't like this president now look at the poll we really story this week presents approval rating among women only thirty two percent of women approve sixty three percent disapprove younger voters eighteen to thirty four only twenty six percent approve of the president's performance sixty seven percent disapprove just do the math the democratic demographic math for this president but also the Republican Party long term that is so devastating it is and I'm sure Republican leaders are looking at polls like this and really sweating the mid term elections frankly because it is right now Democrats are energized I they they really want to vote and then you're looking at the president in you will see how much the president is out on the campaign trail that will also be a reflection in going into August those later Muncie who wants to stand next to this person who the majority countries Russian area tale here is that the last campaign was fought on this battle ground it was spot on the question of temperament and intolerance it didn't quite get them there so the question is is this enough for Democrats to really overcome trump's personality is the force of it that's why I said beginning I would think the price you would think the presentation

tonight's education nation report last night on the broadcast we told you about a new report card that showed America students continue to struggle in terms of both math and reading well tonight we go to the other side of the world Shanghai a city that stunned the world when students there took international exams for the first time ever and outscored every other school system on the planet question is how did that happen and what can American schools learn from what Shanghai is doing our chief education correspondent right hand malice went to Shanghai to find out she's here with us in our New York studios tonight Ranma why they're working very hard in the schools in Shanghai in the one thing that struck me during my visit to China is that kids their love learning and in many ways their success in school is a direct consequence of a whole culture that really values education thank god from the moment the teacher enters the Shanghai students rooted in traditional form ready to learn how to do it than the nine hundred kids at Shanghai yukata high school have nine hours with just a few breaks from working and time now for my massages to relieve stress on weekends and during summer and winter breaks what do you want to study so much because I want to have a better future and do some contribution to our society everything is geared toward the all important college entrance exam for heating system which means that students are taught from a very early age how to beat task on international exams Shanghai scored number one across the board American students ranked fourteenth in reading seventeenth in science and twenty fifth in math you would like to be a business person one day right teachers in Shanghai are among the highest paid educators nationwide showing high is a booming city of twenty three million people but some downplay the academic success here saying it doesn't represent education in China as a whole this is what learning is Mike in most of the nation resources are scarce the result just twenty four percent of rule kids go to college versus eighty percent in Shanghai and sixty four percent in the United States ironically as the world study Shanghai success China is now focusing on the academic weaknesses in terms of management artistic talent management is lacking and that's going to hamper China's ability economy to grow and to compete globally especially with the I. states maybe I'm gonna be a musician or some kind of this is my dream Shanghai students the world's best test takers are now starting to dream of being so much room for all the hours Chinese students spend in school that nation has yet to produce a Steve Jobs mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates but now China is trying to open the door to that kind of academic creativity which America has been known for and experts say it's only a matter of time Brian until China gets there those high school students speaking you in perfect English may be all we need to know absolutely for him Ellis thank you", 'dhhLbTnsQwo': u"now to the latest guidelines from the trump administration our race and its role in college admissions it is also the focus of our weekly education segment making the grade the Obama administration had encourage schools to take a student's race into account to increase diversity but under president trump the administration is now urging colleges and universities to adopt standards that are blind to the role of race and it comes as Harvard University is facing a lawsuit over its admission practices for allegedly excluding some Asian American applicants in order to make room for students of other races Nick Anderson covers higher education for The Washington Post and Marcia Coyle covers the Supreme Court for the national law journal and we welcome both of you to the program Nick Anderson I'm going to start with you so the administration know trump administration is saying the Obama administration went too far there now rescinding seven of what we're so call policy guidance is that were enacted previously what does that mean well what it means is that the federal government's pronouncements on the supreme court's pronouncements have now changed so it you have to go back to the Supreme Court here over a series of rulings over over many years the Supreme Court has grappled with race in admissions and race in schools and then after they issue a ruling from time to time the federal government will sift through that and try to advise school systems and colleges on what it means for them so the Obama administration did that over a period of years from two thousand eleven to two thousand sixteen issued some statements and today the trump administration said basically we're get rid of those statements of they're not operable anymore and Nick Anderson what does that mean for the schools well now that's interesting if you're a college and you see it an incoming change of administration from from Obama to trump you probably already knew that there was a change a foot in the way the federal government view these things but we haven't had a Supreme Court ruling on this for a couple of years now so that folks I've talked to in higher education today suggest that we're not going to see an immediate effect of colleges rushing to change their policies but this action could give some colleges pause as they consider the issue it could say to some colleges Hey wait a minute you might get challenged on this remember that I think you alluded to this already there's a court challenge to Harvard's admission policy in federal court right now in Boston right so that's I think this action by the trump administration adds a dimension to that debate on affirmative action the colleges are going to have to reckon with and let's come back to it let you raise several points I want to come back to a Marshall let's back up further still and look at what have the courts said what is this green court said over time about it taking race into consideration okay this imprint court said in terms of affirmative action that there are two interests that justify the use of race one to remedy the press and the effects of past discrimination and to to achieve diversity in education particularly higher education and the court said that when a university uses race it has to meet the constitution's toughest review what we call strict scrutiny one it has to show that there is that compelling interest achieve diversity or remedy past discrimination and it has to be the use of race has to be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest it can't go any farther than necessary and finally the court has said that it has to show that there are no race neutral alternatives available the court also has said quotas are illegal unconstitutional if you're going to use race it has to be one of many factors out part of a holistic review of the student's application for what Sir what the Obama administration did in interpreting that was leaning in the direction of incorporating race into decisions and now how the trump administration is interpreting it is different they're saying we don't think race should be taken into consideration as much I haven't seen yet in writing with the trump administration is going to issue to universities and in school systems but it's obvious that the Obama administration probably would take as broader view as it could of the supreme court's ruling where is the trump administration being a conservative administration is going to take a narrower view of what it thinks the Supreme courts said but the Supreme Court has has been clear these decisions have been by narrow majorities the last ruling was in two thousand sixteen it was a four three decision we all know there nine justices but it came when justice Scalia seat was still vacant justice Kagan had to re cues because she had been involved in that case from Texas when she was in government so it's four three and it was justice Kennedy who wrote the opinion and it was really the first time he had held an affirmative action program and of course now we're at a moment when justice Kennedy's leaving and we're waiting to see who is grad very fragile majority and Anna and important moment another important moment so Nick Anderson just to come back to this question of how our schools to interpret this you said a minute ago they're likely not to jump and do something immediately but to take their time and what see what more the trump administration says yeah it's worth pointing out that the trump administration's language on this today was very restrained they did not come out and say that they want to end affirmative action the statements from the secretary of education Betsy Divo Austin Attorney General Jeff sessions were fairly limited they were trying to say that the federal government in its previous administration had over stepped slightly or in a significant way in its interpretation of the Supreme Court rulings and they were trying to say that Hey let's just stay with what the judges have said and ruled but they did not then take the next step which is issue a prescription for what it thinks should happen so I think colleges and universities and school systems as well because they're part of this will probably be looking for further actions and words from the trump administration on what it actually wants and of course everybody's eyes are on the Supreme Court nomination to come no question and and Marcia just quickly back to that harbor case that is hand working its way up through the courts it where how is the the challenges that Harvard has been over backwards to it not that it in another words it hasn't done enough about race those of different races beyond those or Asian and lead the charge is that they've discriminated against Asian Americans in their admissions policy and it's not just Harvard there's a lawsuit as well against the university of North Carolina and I think it's it's important just to or interesting to note that the man in the his organization that brought those two lawsuits is the same one who brought the university of Texas challenge to the Supreme Court in two thousand sixteen those two cases are very early stages there in federal District Court there probably will be a trial they've had months of discovery and we'll it'll take awhile before they get to the US Supreme Court all of this says what Elijah worth pointing out if I can jump in here that the harbor cases like the Detroit significant publicity because its Harvard and and also just a note that harbored strongly denies these allegations Nick Anderson Marcia Coyle with thank you both pleasure thank you",

time it's Indiana democratic state representative Justin mow ed and mow ed is engaged to be married and he was caught sexting so this is another of so called scandal that's more Anthony Weiner style because of course he did the same thing where he was actually **** anybody he was just sexting and it was cheating in that respect which is a much less degree of cheating but according to the Indianapolis star this guy said quote I am truly sorry I have heard the ones I love most with my poor judgment this is a private matter and I ask for it to be treated as such I apologize to my constituents and to everyone I have let down now why should we give a **** about this well my response is we shouldn't because this guy is a hypocrite you know he's not holding up his own private life is some sort of ideal he's not screaming about family values are putting down gay people so in essence is none of our business because this is in an area where he is being a hypocrite his policies are totally separate from how we act in his private life but what makes this interesting is his affair so called affair was with Sydney leathers that's the same woman that had the affair with so called affair with Anthony Weiner it is the same thing apparently he responded to an ad posted by letters do what can add is letters doing nowadays I'm I'm asking I'm being genuine I'm being serious here I'm not like being tongue in cheek it which your strip is she doing house calls much going on here I assume she's not putting out ads because she wants to play park cheesy with people so I don't know the deal is with that but this guy responded to the ad and here's my question what **** voodoo spell does this woman have over democratic politicians apparently if you're elected Democrat you can help yourself Oilers any letters the new ones are on their guard politician I got as a as a new others or sexed Sydney wondered because those whose adjusted he loves and what she does she does sexting with democratic politicians that's like her job I don't know what kind of good spell she cast over them but I find this hilarious and if I'm not mistaken I think she was the one the release this information which is kind of **** up you know because again disguising hypocrite this guy this is something is private business and she like went out of her way to be I'll release it anyway ma'am means I'm kind of starting a hater right now you know again if this is a Republican in their hypocrite that's a different story that's a different conversation that should be exposed but if it's somebody who is just their private business and this doesn't affect their policy in any way yeah he was a douche bag because he had a fiance but that's not that's not of our business and you're putting it on out but just a warning to any other democratic politicians who may be unsuspectingly stumbling around and doing things like this avoids any letters because there's something in the DNA of democratic politicians where they must sector", 'rsTpowJAQFk': u"in order to explain some of president trump's bizarre foreign policy moves were often told that he is unconventional and this could well be an asset but it's certainly true he doesn't follow standard operating procedure on almost anything from getting daily briefings to stopping the state department but his most striking departure from previous presidents has been his rhetoric American presidents have tended to weigh their words carefully believing that they must preserve the credibility of the world's leading power and then there is Donald Trump for holding words are weightless during the campaign he excoriated Saudi Arabia as a country that once women as slaves and kill gays only to make his first presidential trip abroad to the kingdom and warmly embrace its rulers he said NATO was obsolete and then simply informed the opposite there are situations where such flexibility might work on North Korea trump threatened to rain fire and fury on the country only now to welcome in meeting with this need from supporters say this is just the kind of maneuvering that could well produce a deal that is included more conventional approaches to the problem we should all hope that it will so far though it's worth noting that the circus like atmosphere of trump's alternating threads and embraces has obscured a key point it is trump who has made the concessions not Kim Jong moon the American position has long been that until North Korea took some concrete steps toward denuclearization there would be no talks until recently the trump administration itself insisted that he would not reward the nuclear buildup would negotiations now there's a good argument to be flexible on this procedural issue but we should be aware that so far Kim Jong moon seems to be executing a smart strategy brilliantly he embarked on a fast track build up creating a genuine nuclear arsenal with missiles that can deliver the weapons around the world he risked tensions with the world and even his relations with China now with the arsenal built he's mending relations with China reaching out to South Korea and offering to negotiate with Washington trump's skill humor might well be his willingness to abandon totally a bass position and fully endorse the new one the United States after all will have to accept something less than its long declared goal the complete denuclearization of North Korea and maybe trump will be able to find some way to sell this there is however a different kind of tough talk that is more wiring the trump administration pushes hard on some issue trade with South Korea for example then announces a deal claiming to have one significant concessions in fact most of these have been symbolic concessions made by allies to allow the administration to save face South Korea for example agreed to raise the number of because each American order manufacturer can sell in the country from twenty five thousand to fifty thousand it's it is a concession to make no American companies sold even eleven thousand cars there last year see America remains a superpower its allies search for ways to accommodate it the trump administration can keep making outlandish demands and it will obtain some concessions because no one wants an open bridge with the United States if from says the Europeans have to come up with some changes to the Iran deal maybe they will find some way to do so because they don't want to see the deal collapse and they don't want to see the west fall into disarray this is not a sign of power but rather the abuse of power when the bush administration forced issues of countries to support the Iraq war this did not signal American strength it actually sap that strip

are in government understand their role are it seems very clear of that the department of homeland security is not taking its responsibility seriously and there there is an effort to obfuscate the dimensions of this problem that is the entry of illegal immigrants and the free flow of drugs the deadliest methamphetamine heroin cocaine you name it across that border from Mexico exactly right I think secretary Nielsen needs to get in there and clean some house the people that are running the border patrol now the some of the more the architects of the original catch and release program for Pete's sake I'd I'd I do not understand what's going on there additionally she should have been fighting for the restart restoration of monies for these border patrol agents we have the problem that we have is you have this invasion coming over every day and then you have this organized invasion coming from the central American states and at the same time we have border patrol stations in Arizona that are fifty percent of their a compliment because the their morale is so low and it's low because we haven't supported them there's about high turnover among so yeah the patrol yes exactly a it's a very tough job the morale I understand to be you know it depths not seen in in ages and the dimensions of this problem the late or whether it's the business roundtable the chamber of commerce the coke brothers Wall Street they are perfectly willing to lie about the numbers of illegal immigrants in this country using the same number that we use more than a decade ago eleven million illegal immigrants of the Yale MIT study saying clearly so unequivocally at least at least twenty two million and certainly as high as thirty million in this country that throws into is just it's an absolute appealable of the estimates of costs of what we're spending on welfare on social programs on education for illegal immigrants in this country by its stunning what the business establishment the left wing the radical Democratic Party and yes the bush administration in our member the they do jobs Americans won't do are pure utter nonsense I a yes supporter we know a premiere well first of all you're exactly right are part one of our problems is they view static numbers we we know that we're catching people and we know that there's give aways there probably four times as many people as to who we apprehend so you know that they're coming through and they're staying the used to go home work seasonally and go home which was a different animal altogether but I was just on the border last Friday and I can tell you Lou if we don't build a border wall and secure our southern border we will actually lose our sovereignty I believe I mean you you won't have a border you won't have any you know that one plan at one time this call north American union a George Bush wasn't too worried on the lease a rice about what was happening with our borders because they meant to quote unquote harmonize our borders with Canada and with Mexico so you know and the and and it it's just it's just an extraordinary what are we have seen two successive presidents bush and Obama due to this country's sovereignty the president has said a congressman bags that if Mexico does not respond to his request he will order the U. S. military to our southern border and shut it down to stop this on slop is he calls it and it is it leaves that we've got a million a million people in this country legally every year as eight in chain migration we got a million crossing that border the estimates range anywhere from six hundred to a million we really have no idea are illegally into the country our end and we're spending a fortune I it is unconscionable what has happened what are your thoughts about the president's declaration I I think he I think he needs to do it I supported and I'll tell you why you we need more personnel on the border today we have we have these barriers that people and you know you can watch the videos are people able to shinny over get down there hurting themselves jumping down so what we see is a lots of people coming over lots of people claiming asylum and we need to have a presence on the border that is spelled with the military that's a good that's a good thing and it's necessary and I think president trump's instincts are correct on this and it's a national security issues you as you know Lou some of the people that are coming across are not would call the you know the most wholesome of people some of them and some of them but it but in point of fact these are people who are are for the most part minimally educated they have minimal skills if any are and and there is no Central America and Mexico been exporting their poor shoot to this country and it's it's got to stop it is we simply cannot afford it you know it if it were one thing of this country were not a welfare society now everyone of these illegal immigrants enters and is it immediately entitled to education to welfare to all sorts of social programs it's stunning what it costs are congressman absolutely is always it's good to see you could be within what what's your bet on Mexico well they helping makes it I think they're going to help I think the president trump's leveraging them we just signed a new trade agreement and I think that they're going to have to step in a little bit I I think they're going to be just to a sieve though a sieve and more people could come in but those but but some help for us I'd like to see that I've Manuel Lopez Obrador I think our represents a real opportunity as the new president of Mexico come December I I think he represents a real opportunity for this president to find a partner who will be responsible and treat the the border in people's on both sides of that border with respect for a a new millennium we hope let's hope so let's hope so Congress are great to see Andy Vic thankless", 'H-b2U0DNKVo': u"a historic moment in red states Texas on primary night all of us together we're gonna fight for change army veteran and former sheriff Lupe Valdez becoming the first openly lesbian and first Latina thank yous to ever win a major party nomination for governor in this state the truth because Texas has a of a variety of people were not just one culture were not just one thing the November ballot will reflect that more than fifty LGBTQ candidates are running for office in Texas that's three times more than the state has seen in any other election cycle how are you if elected former intelligence officer Gino Ortiz Jones will be the first lesbian Iraq war veteran and first generation Filipino American present Texas in the U.

announced this afternoon it is reversing an Obama era policy that encouraged colleges to consider race during the college admissions process correspondent you're attending reports tonight on what

from twenty eleven and twenty sixteen laid out legal recommendations for schools looking to use affirmative action trumps DOJ argues that the Obama administration's guidance isn't legally sound and goes beyond Supreme Court precedent on that issue rescinding the guidelines doesn't change the wall but supporters of the moo hope it pushes colleges to change it will be one more step in discouraging universities and colleges from using race and ethnicity as a criteria for admissions that should not be happening in America in the year of two thousand and eighteen Attorney General Jeff sessions is now rescinded dozens of guidance documents issued by the Obama administration after launching a review last year DOJ determined a lot of the obamacare policies were inconsistent with the constitution saying today the executive branch can not circumvent Congress or the courts by creating guidance that goes beyond the law and in some instances stays on the books for decades but critics suggested this reversal is a politically motivated attack on affirmative action all across the country we're seeing a coordinated a series of attacks on race conscious policies in the higher and context it sends the wrong message to administrators and college presidents all across our country that are working hard to ensure diversity on their campuses the Supreme Court last held that affirmative action

S. will soon face a stricter review process according to a memo released last week immigration officials would be able to reject visa applications on the spot if there is missing or inadequate information previously they had a chance to make fixes now the changes could result in sudden visa denials in deportation Anastasia to mellow is an immigration lawyer and president of the American immigration lawyers association good to see you and this would affect your clients in who exactly are these folks this is these are skilled worker visas who is this so really this affects American employers who want to hire the best person for a position so the process to sponsor an employee that is not an American worker is actually a pretty intense process so they make a filing with the immigration service and now we have this potential that a case could be denied without a roof of we'll review and just quickly bookkeeping or talk about a couple hundred thousand people on these pieces yes all of that yes and this would apply these new policies both the people renewing and people trying to come to the country absolutely so that's another big change so earlier on in in October last year or they'd changed the the difference memo which basically says they don't have to give any difference to a previously approved applications so these are people who are already here just because you get the first time doesn't mean we're going to see a second time exactly Hey I and so this new change what exactly does it do and what's the impact so what it does is it gives immigration officers the authority on review of the petition for an immigration benefit can be employment family based if they don't believe that it's unprovable they have now have the authority to deny it without asking for information and what's what's worrying about that is that in practice the vast number of requests for additional information which is what these are called are actually and ultimately approved because there could be some misunderstanding there something that the the immigration services and understand so they're not necessarily based on fraud which I think is what they're they're how they're touting this one with the position to is that okay we're not trying to catch typos here if it's a small fix will let you make that fix but what we want to put an end to his people submitting basically placeholder applications which are very incomplete but I want to get in line and then sometime down the road I'll fill in the rest of the application is that a true thing to address so I I've looked at some numbers of the number of cases that are filed and ultimately approved and I mean you're talking about a very small number that are actually denied on the basis of the of of these reasons which really leads me to believe that this of you're talking as a small percentage of cases that this could actually be be an issue I think for the most part it's giving officers of forty two just deny things to move things along with his agenda I think the answer is we won't know to this goes into effect in September but they have some discretion in I guess we we're not really sure what impact this will have like what kind of numbers are talking about exactly and I think that's the whirring thing I think for a certain positions we saw about fifty percent of petitions had a request for evidence last year and so if you're eliminating that stand then you could look at a a large increase of gentiles last thing you see this as part of a broader effort to change the way legal immigration works absolutely we're calling this the invisible wall this is that brick by brick that is getting put up on legal immigration people are following the rules standing

decided just hours after this attack to make this an immigration issue which is a little confusing because when a neo **** kill someone by plowing their car into a group of people in Charlottesville trump took a very different approach I didn't I wanted to make sure unlike most politicians that what I said was correct not make a quick statement to you know make statements that direct unless you know the fact it takes a little while to get the facts you still don't know the facts and it's a very very important process to me so I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement I want to know the facts heart soul when it wasn't not see trump needed more facts when it was a Muslim that was the only fact that he needed and now the president is still pretty new to politics so other than being a fundamentally dishonest person where did you learn to do this well from the same place place that he learns everything the trump intelligence briefing A. K. fox news it's interesting to see how fox's feeling about politicizing attack depends on whether it furthers the narrative and we don't have to look far for instance just a month ago off to Vegas a mass shooting by a white guy fox's reaction was the polar opposite of how they're reacting off to New York a terror attack by a Muslim immigrants in the midst of tragedy the rush to politicize the war shooting in American history shameful of the left has no shape what about people that are here that we never vetted you can't even that people that are in here without being called racist and Islamophobic I thought it was inappropriate yesterday for people in this early hours to be jumping up and raising this as an issue you know let's wait a few days see what happens as far as the Betty I agree we do have to have improved ready increase reading the bodies are still warm and people are exploiting this for their own parties and gain sadly this event just reinforces all the efforts the president has made with regards to reforming immigration the extreme vetting it's just not the time to dive into the politics and try to score political points this guy who committed this crime assuming that he did commit this crime his entire family should be deported for fox you can politicized things as long as it's not guns so simple as that I bet they wouldn't even talk about guns in a game of clue it was colonel mustard in the study with the you know what it doesn't really matter and yeah it doesn't matter what weapon he used the point is people are dead and it's time to move on let's let's bring up the monopoly come on let's move on look here's my opinion I don't think politicize needs to be a dirty word unlike the was chunky almost I think tragedies like what happened in Vegas in New York City should be politicized yeah I said it because politics is how society works to solve problems you can still be sensitive to the victims but you should be working to politicize I think we should have these conversations but if we do have the conversations can we please find someone who doesn't sound like this I am two days starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery program I am going to ask Congress to immediately initiated work to get rid of this program diverse serene diversity lottery diversity lottery sounds nice it's not nice it's not good for that's not good it hasn't been good we've been against it you know what trump was thinking right as he saw that word he probably looked on it was like I'll long words my ultimate add adverse to Terry my ultimate advert advert zord said my ultimate my bad guys English and reading is so bad he would probably fail his own immigration test but the way the divers to TV so lottery that Donald Trump has always been against and obviously just learned about today it wasn't some brown people charity ski right it was possible nineteen nineties with bipartisan support and was signed in by a Republican president in fact was an attempt to get more Irish immigrants into America because people forget that when they say immigrants it doesn't always mean brown there are millions of white immigrants including Donald Trump grandparents I mean if you ask me America success is tied to the fact that this is a nation of immigrants who work together towards an ideal that's a strength but that said if the president thinks the adversity visa program needs a second look then I'm all for talking about it let's talk about it now I'm just saying let's not be hypocrites because think about this New York happened yesterday writes that isn't happened yesterday and now trump is ready to cancel the entire diversity visa program at the Las Vegas shooting happened a month ago and Congress still hasn't done anything to regulate bomb stocks the device that the shooter used to turn his weapon into a machine gun by the done nothing no banning no registering but even a law that if you buy a bomb stock the guy at the counter has to give you a dirty look nothing so why don't we have the conversation about immigration and the conversation about guns at the same time I think America's resilience enough to handle it in fact I know it it's because yesterday New York it doesn't matter whether you were born here or immigrated here or lived here during the Jurassic period what Matt said is that everyone came together to do what New York does best dressed crazy and party till dawn", 'N8TP4v0r_wg': u"the situation will good afternoon to find the stern on CNN numbers from the pew research center they

Muslim forty three percent don't know among Republicans twenty seven percent believe these Christian thirty one percent believe these Muslim thirty nine percent say they don't know how do you explain I don't know other than the other the fact that people just were willing to believe anything on a lot of stupid people out there I I really don't have an ex right and just like I don't have an explanation for the fact that you see somebody's Paul that a quarter of people believe he was born outside the country it is I don't the Bob I'm on this for marks is the next person maybe Thomas Martin may maybe has a good answer this Tony yeah I think so I would compare it to what happened to Benjamin Disraeli the British prime minister mid nineteenth century he was suspected of being a Jew all through his career his dad had been Jewish but he backed eyes the young Benjamin in church of England and it remained a practicing Christian with Jewish ancestry I think was a similar situation with Obama his father was obviously Muslim and and he and so that suspicion is there and then I think the things what's interesting is the numbers about west for him since he's been president and I think some of his his decisions the out reach his long good is that as it may be wise it may be encourages some his is getting into a fight with the Israeli prime minister and and his lack of attending church conspicuously although Reagan might present I work for didn't go to church much because he said it was it would interrupt the congregation so there are good reasons may be good reasons for it but public is gonna think what is going to think and he is not made it easier sure he worry about this at all president James or should be I do something about this I guess I mean I I would I would dispute that town is the only public thank talking I think that it wasn't born in United States I mean it did when it would to birth announcements and both on the little paper that I again that does I don't have an explanation and and and the quality of information available to people to date is next with actually hard it was and and and nineteenth century England but I you know other than you you gotta assume that that people are just well some people willing to believe anything and some people just out now stupid I I because the White House is they don't have a I wish I had a better explanation of what the White House issued a statement today saying president Obama is a committed Christian and his faith is an important part of his daily life he prays every day seeks a small circle of Christian pastors to give them spiritual advice and counseling even receives a daily devotional that he uses each morning does he need to do more or do you think it's at all portent Tony for him to do more to visibly for example go to church on Sunday well if I look it's it's tricky because now that the down is there you don't want to seem like you're you're you're you're exploiting in some way so I'm not sure what he could do but sure I would think if he could is not good for a majority of the country to doubt the sincerity of the president's expressed faith publicly expressed right he says he's a Christian and I'm enjoying the country is not convinced he said telling the truth that's not a good political situation to be yet again I go back to the fact that people believe he was born outside of the United States contrary to to to uncontroverted evidence that people will believe that it's not his fault that people were believed to stop but it what what day and I made of the fact that there have been a put a state not tone is absolutely right if you go to church denotes out look at that age is doing it and it and whatever but I I I I don't think it I mean I I know it's not his fault that people would believe affirmation of which is no basis in fact that you know there's a lot of people believe the earth is five thousand years old I mean they explain that to you can't just flying it it it's it's not it's not a coincidence that the first president whose father was a Muslim some Americans think maybe like father like son that's on it that they they they they they may well be wrong but that's not an irrational things I mean you understand why it happened caustic of course they wrong just it again I go back to that they believe that he was born outside the United States not one thing is if I was you know out for the active one things in trying to explain it there are explanations that it would look for the way people you know which that conclusion white this is why I think the point that James is trying to make it I think it's a valid point in that recent CNN poll twenty seven percent of the American public had doubts that our president Obama was born in the United States twenty seven percent even though the all the evidence shows that he was born in Hawaii Tony why do so many people have these doubts well I mean I I I I don't want to review all of the the explanations obviously that the public he's it he is not your standard cookie cutter American present as he said Barca's think what when he was running this is not the regular guy you expect to see on a dollar bill so coming along with all of the different ness off him from from his race to everything else isn't it's understandable not not endorsing but it's understandable why people would say Gee he's kind of different from the normal Protestant white president where you're sitting there I mean give me a white car a explanation of how what to cook a cada explanation of how he wasn't born in the United States just give me a rational a what a rational person would believe that he wasn't born United States what the cookie cutter explanation well his father wasn't born and I save most presidents not all but most of the marathon is or what I'm just saying you're asking for an explanation I mean that that I does not an explanation that is fall the one body I stated what what when I'm I love everybody is I've been told I'm not endorsing urine simply saying I'm not Fleming I'm not white people which you know learns lessons I may be wrong I am Brian flummoxed at people that stupid I am I like I guess I shouldn't you haven't seen enough of my life but I haven't seen enough of life James and James car I don't know how great I I shouldn't be I I agree I shouldn't a lot of folks are flummoxed by these answers", 'rs6Oo2nN4BY': u"the United States military had a lot of experience in the western Pacific taking down small islands a not so veiled warning

resigned following the Monica Lewinsky scandal in an interview for CBS Sunday morning the former First Lady and presidential candidate spoke with twenty to couple about the record number of women running for office in two thousand eighteen she was also asked about her husband's conduct will president there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United States cannot have a consensual relationship with and in turn the power imbalances to what an adult but let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made and which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and it as I believe came out in the right place turning a couple is here with more from that interview Tony good morning you asked the question I did as a question it was a wide ranging conversation is about an hour long conversation and you know Hillary Clinton knows more than perhaps anyone about what it's like to be a a woman in politics he's a two time presidential candidate and she became in twenty sixteen the first woman to win a major party's nomination we sat down to talk about sexism politics and why this year's crop of female candidates may still feel like they're running up hill what mornings you have as we reach crunch time in the twenty eighteen campaign for the women who are out there running you just have to be yourself come hell or high water you just have to be yourself and say more about the health part yeah I know sometimes it is so apparent that you are being judged on your hair your clothes that all of that and you know you look over at the mails running and you know they're no fashion icons but nobody is saying I'm not voting for him because he didn't call his hair I'm not voting for him because you know his soon as rumble of course even as Hillary Clinton supports female candidate she holds a complicated position in the ME two era remember her husband president Bill Clinton was accused of multiple acts of sexual misconduct before becoming president and was impeached over lies he told about his relationship with a White House intern Hillary Clinton stood by his side through all of that looking back do you wish you had done things differently in your personal life in the nineties and if you had do you think it would help to politically in twenty sixteen it's an easy question to answer no now on both counts I did what I thought was right and I feel very good about that when you support women now who are running with their stories of sexual assault front center does it make it more difficult for you to be forward as a supporter when you have not contended fully with the accuser is in your own life well no because there was the most intense comprehensive investigation people forget that and I don't I remember it very clearly and in retrospect do you think bill should have resigned president Clinton should have resigned in the nineties in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not so it was an abuse of power now you do not believe he should resign now how do you contend with members of your own party now saying he should have that's that's their right to their opinion but they were not in the middle of it now bill and Hillary Clinton will kick off a series of speaking engagements together next month in Las Vegas where I imagine this may come up yet again now of course the past never changes people's perspective on the past tense to change and it appears in this case Hillary Clinton's perspective has not even Monica Lewinsky's perspective has changed over one and she said even in a few decades ago them you know I answer in summary is there a double standard being applied here and and help was very quite clear no there's not or if there is it's one that benefits the current occupant of the White House him she is so much more than what her husband did in the on a lot and she is absolutely arson and continues to be defined by that all right thank you Tony to couple", 'JLEdDuil85s': u"well I mean it's a question how you view trump I mean obviously by any past standards this is not normal behavior for diplomacy may not obviously in the end we're all hoping and certain markets at this point counting on a lot of this this just being political posturing in this is trumping trump and but obviously they're they're playing with fire here in terms of all the protection is talk and the hope is in the end that the series trade war is averted not to say there will be some tariffs on a small amount of goods relative to the overall size of the economy but in the end I think the hope in the presumption in the markets is and that a lot of this is posturing and that too is a large extent sense will prevail but I mean you several hoping they're all a large amount of Americans who want to build a supposition see phone ins every weekend and great says well who believe that Mr trump gets things done they like the way he rips off the protocol doesn't sign communiques which he doesn't agreement and goodness knows team on I've been in dismay at many G. seventy eight and G. twenty private communiques over the years because they've just been very bland and have not she stated very much as well not anything meaningful is the present actually achieving anything is what I'm asking well I mean a communique itself doesn't really matter in the in the scheme of things of course many in the end it does matter if there is serious protectionism now so far we've had and tariffs on steel and aluminum witcher a tiny part of the economy and even the fifty billion that's been talked about in terms of terrorists and the the amount of goods being terrorist and with China if that goes through is pretty tiny compared with the twelve twenty at trillion US economy but the question is where does this and does it keep growing and as retaliation leach retaliation in retaliation to retaliation retaliation etcetera etcetera mean so I mean it this this is playing with fire for sure and but I do think in the end and to a large extent sense will prevail I mean maybe that's wishful thinking but I mean that seems to be what is in the market to this point as well for for all the negative Coventry around the weekend meeting I mean that was kind send to a language that came out of the initial communique and I think you can take that on board at least and see that as say a positive direction of travel the fact that everybody signed up to the idea of free Farah mutually beneficial trade now did get a little spoiled at the end because of the spot with true dive but but this is not the huge divergence away from the title of world that is Katniss trade growing for the lost twenty thirty years M. will certainly me trump himself will say that is for free trade M. but the question is how do you get there and in terms of how willing is he to to pick fights and to put tariffs on in in the process of trying to negotiate a better deal for the US and it certainly is playing with fire the snow queen okay that'll be posted this morning coming out of Asia I'm gonna come believe that's all about the impending summit in Singapore no I think the feeling is that this is largely posturing that in the end we we we we won't see a a major trade war I mean I think that's been I mean the the the way people looked at this so far mean obviously again by pass standards the sort of language and behavior that could be extrapolated as the end of the western alliance but I think people are thinking this is not normal standards with trump and I think you have to discount it to a certain extent know again whether that's the right view or not remains to be seen Hey everybody at

S. although we continue to see upside surprises to the incoming data but that's definitely the same for the next several years so the take away from the federal reserve at the moment is okay very knowledge in that but we can keep on high kick this brought to the pros works for us doesn't seem to be breaking and I think yet are they going to keep going until they do break something I think cell and that's and that's really the risk right because typically in past fed rate hike cycles you tend to see a slowdown a recession because the federal shoots its its target or it's neutral fed funds rate and tightens mantra policy too much as it is using a lot of feed through into the into the broader economy especially interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy are starting to come under pressure whether be housing or auto loans you starting to see the see the feed through from high interest rates in the sectors and the concern is that if they're much more data dependent less dependent on sort of the mutual fed funds rate they want to deflect the market away from focusing on the edge of five hundred if that happens if they continue to hike once a quarter the risk is that the model we should dispensers point Jim we say this in the equities housing sit in the old house they can pass it off the back of this we think the fed is getting to the point where it could be making a mistake very soon you look at the housing market the housing stocks top in January we think the message of the last four weeks in the equity market with this volatility is that stocks are becoming uncomfortable with the level of rates you look at intended growth we're going to slow down next year two and a half is consensus one nine in twenty nineteen and there's no inflation we've

down seventy eighty point to the opening bell this morning but he got Talian debt according to the headlines you know it's already sitting on the pilot that is easily and now they've been yet made plans to increase the deficit to three times more than the previous government that has the markets a little spooked toys just reluctant to talk about how he and death it was just for the record other than the fact that the truth of it right all right stock of the day I'm pretty sure it's going to be Tesla is gonna open way down twelve percent plus the government to suit the lan must for fraud tell me more about this said the suit ash yeah listen the SEC recommending that Taylor must pay a penalty but also won the Bahrain for being head of any public company I want to give you a couple of statements here then the room in the off the mass of what the SEC is claiming first on the board it says test on the board of directors of fully confident in the lawn his integrity and his leadership of the company which has resulted in the most successful US auto company in over a century our focus remains on the continued ramp of modern three production and delivering for our customers shareholders employees okay so that's the stuff from the mobile what about musk himself was saying that he put out this is it this on justified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed I've always taken action in the best interests of truth transparency and investors integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromise this in any way by the way of the stock box below to seventy eight forty five according to a Charlie Brady a senior editor that means the market value of testable full below that of General Motors is right about that level right now are you close to that so even in a market cap at this point but yeah should fall below GM because city group of so just cut it to sell from yes also that's coming in as well city says is going to go down to two twenty five just in from the right now is to see for the last nearly thirteen percent down yeah stay on test one market watcher Garrick help bomb with us this morning Gary I know you're no fan of tests that you're no fan of mosque you think he's done at least a CEO at this point well I'm a big fan of musk as an innovator but not a real a handler of this company if if you remember the day after I was on your show at this was flawed in plain sight and that's why I think the FCC was able to come very quickly that's not normal for the SEC at and do this I think you he's in big trouble I think they mean business are I'm surprised I got I guess they put a settlement on the table and must backed away but I gather that settlement had to ban all of it of a certain time frame and they just put the hammer down and the biggest problem for this company is they need to raise money going forward they've had the wind that they're back within easy money environment and a strong stock price if that changes not good news for a company that loses a ton of money every time they produce a car so our next few months going to be big big stuff for this because he is Tesla more than any part a CEO in this country means more to the company maybe Bezos a little bit more to Amazon what he means mortar company then either any other company out there so if Mustang is eventually out to to Tesla and we don't know that but if right is out at some point you're telling me that Tesla doesn't look like much of a company without it they need to have some people in there that know how to run this company and do better with the financials by the way this tweet was bad enough but he has been promising a lot of things for a couple years that never came through and they were investigating that also and if I was distant just give a guesstimate I think he's worth about a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars to the spot price if he goes bye bye but keep in mind this is going to be played out over a decent period of time I'm talking a lot a month so I don't think this happen anytime soon but leave no doubt the stock price is going to take a hit and probably gonna go lower from even here on the gap to the downside hold on one second former Gary Susan one out so basically this lifetime ban of being an official an executive at a company for Tesla and evil must highly unusual highly unprecedented risen Steve Cohen room SEC capital paid a record fine when it came to the SEC to settle those claims of insider trading he's banned for only two years Martha Stewart went to jail she's only band for five years from being a CEO or executive of any companies a lifetime ban I mean doesn't this seem excessive in this case so unusual that's for sure but what Gary wants to that one last one city group says a test the stock could test down to two twenty five that's about in line with your your point of view I think go to a hundred to a hundred and fifty you gotta remember something even with this drop today it has a market cap just a little bit less than GM yet but GM has ten times the sales and makes a ton of money member this is a money losing company and he is very lucky we're in a bull market and an easy money environment if that also changes that's going to be a real I don't know if it's a death knell for the company but that's going to be big trouble they need to raise money in the next few months they have a lot of bonds coming due and if they can't raise that there's gonna be some serious issues my friend", 'Ir2BfbOej2w': u"hello everyone I'm meteorologist Ashley batey and all eyes are focused on and this storm hurricane Florence winds have decreased a little bit this morning down to a hundred and thirty miles an hour but that's only because it's under gone what's called an eye wall replacement cycle that temporarily weakens the storms but as we put the tracker on you can see by tomorrow morning we're still anticipating this to strengthen into in the neighborhood of one hundred and fifty miles an hour a category five is one fifty seven or a Bob we certainly flirt with that before we see a little bit of weakening as it approaches the Carolina's coastline on Thursday likely during the evening and then from there it's going to stall across the area meaning a big of flooding threat is in the forecast models becoming more and more confident about where the storm is going to make landfall it looks like it will be in North Carolina and from there we'll see this kind of set before eventually moving off toward the north and for about two days this storm is only going to move about a hundred miles or so that means we're gonna see a lot of rain associated with this store wanted him into the Carolinas look at some of these rainfall totals this is just the room Monday we could actually see some higher numbers as a result but there will be isolated spots a could see between thirty five to forty inches of rain that doesn't include storm surge flooding that is the inland rain the rainfall totals coming down with this so flooding in one is going to be a big concern it is going to be a window that just based on how strong the storm is going to be when it makes landfall and of course then along the coastal areas where hopefully everyone evacuates because this is a serious storm that's where we could see storm surges up around ten feet let's talk about the timing of these wins it would be Thursday morning when we would start seeing tropical storm force winds moving into parts of the Carolinas and things would really start to decrease actually into Wednesday evening those ones will gradually be picking up there and then all of that water would begin to be pushed on shore wanna make sure everyone knows not to focus on where the center of the storm is going to be because look at the way field with that's pretty much all of eastern North Carolina is going to see at least tropical storm force winds if not hurricane strength and that will continue for several hours in fact a couple of days as a storm only gradually loses some of that intensity gradually weekends once it's over land it misses out on that fuel which for hurricanes is warm water and we need at least eighty degree water we got plenty of that out there as a result we do have three storms that were

Tennessee forty seven percent far below seventy eight percent the nation wide graduation rate for all public school students and ninety eight percent for private school students the study's author argues it's not a matter of race but resource when you look at the data and you look at the number of white males who are in poor poorly resource districts like Detroit are you'll find at the graduation rate for white males is only nineteen percent but the study emphasizes black males are less likely to have access to early education highly effective teachers and resources like tutors and well stocked libraries in Harlem Geoffrey Canada has spent his career raising money to run his public charter school like a private school we can afford as a nation to remove a whole group of folks from being taxpayers and actually put them as expenses are for the taxpayers to have to pay for success is happening in Chicago urban prep academy the entire senior class in this all black male public charter school graduated and all are college bound what we do at the schools we have extended school day we have an extended school year we set high expectations we give the students an opportunity and a pathway roadmap to meet those expectations a nation wide governors in forty eight states have agreed it is time to raise the common core standards for children at every grade level to make sure they're on track for graduation and beyond Brian kind of a national embarrassment ton of reasons why this has happened but if you're watching this at home tonight you're probably thinking how can we possibly fix that still bomb administration has a plan a contest they call race to the top four billion dollars they want to a war to those states that do certain things lake teacher pay to student performance increase the number of charter schools shut down failing schools actually adopt those core standards they also say you gotta get student discipline under control and parents have to get involved a student's report card should never be a surprise to a parent who's paying attention not just at the end of the year but in the beginning right now because all the way to each individual

part of the country with US has a presence will Russians recently threatened to enter the area allegedly to pursue what they call are terrorists last week Russians also launched air strikes on the northern province of Idlib that's the last major rebel held territory in the country president trump and the administration of giving clear warnings against the attacks and this comes months after president trump vowed to leave the country here's what he had to say back in March we spent and I was against it from the beginning they try and say well maybe not I was against it from the beginning and by the way we're not get the hell out of ISIS will become at a serial like very soon let the other people take care of it now very soon very soon with coming out we're gonna have a hundred percent of the caliphate as they call it sometimes referred to as land take it all back quickly quickly but this week the US envoy for Syria James Jeffrey said quote the new policy we're no longer where we are no longer pulling out by the end of the year will for more on this we're joined by Middle East security director of the center for a new American security foundation a long Goldenberg joins us now so even if this change appears to be in part a response to Iran's presence in the region walk us through this what's the big concern right now sure I think one of the big concerns is Iran Iran is deeply invested in Syria has been throughout the conflict to win because the Iranians should go ahead does no no go ahead sure because Iran and the views Syria as where how it basically protects out into the Levant projects out into Lebanon puts pressure on Israel has invested in has ballot for a generation and so the Iranians have been doing is really the Iranians have created the ground force that has essentially become the ASA's ground force and we're talking about a hundred thousand mile Iranian militia are so is Danny train militia Askin Lucia Iraqi Syrian Lebanese octane by Iran but basically been the key to re taking most of the country combining it Iranian ground forces with Russian airforce and some support from the asset regime itself and so I think part of that motivation lease the trump administration is to push back on Iran but it seems like it might just be too late for that honestly both based on a dead ministrations policy for the last fifteen months and the Obama administration's policy for the first two years of this conflict you know we heard that the chief of staff general Dunford come forward and say that they're not afraid to push forward of chemical weapons are used at this point do you get the sense that there will be some sort of military action taken at this point by the United States are we closer to intervening and what and what would it mean to intervene at this point no I don't think we're intervening at this point it's too late in the game the bottom line is but just a few months ago accurate Iran combined with Russia and the outsiders in took a large chunk of southern Syria this is an area of the country where we actually had trained a lot of opposition forces working with Jordan is out to our closest allies and even in that situation and we even had a ceasefire actually in that situation it was negotiated by the trump administration with the Russians a date touted as a huge success just a year ago and the Russians and the outsiders even Iran totally violated it I took over this entire area in the south the U. S. talks a little bit about things but essentially let them do it so we're not having to protect our closest allies in here in the in the province it's much more complicated it's the Turks who hold parts of his territory and a lot more out kind of presence in this territory so we were willing to defend our own our partners and allies in the south why would anybody believe that we're going to defend all cried out now against the asset regime Russian you're on I don't see this credible you don't see it as as credible in the Denver said this I want to ask you the last week you we know Russia conducted these air strikes on aid when the trump administration is made very strong warnings against these attacks trump himself said that the attacks were grave and humanitarian risk how exactly has this affected US Russia relations what was far it remains to be seen on that front I mean we just need to be pulled back for a second talk about it live we might be seeing the beginning of the biggest humanitarian catastrophe of the Syrian civil war and that's saying something for a conflict that is seen over five hundred thousand killed and millions displaced because it's been happening for the last couple of years is our side with his allies even take we systematically retaking different pieces of the country one after the other and then what do they do is they get to the point where it becomes inevitable that they're gonna win and then to go see it a ceasefire with the opposition and what does the opposition do is part of that gets moved to England and so even moving and moving and moving hundreds of thousands of people into it live there's no place for them to go now so when if this offensive starts in a major way you're going to see potentially huge refugee flows into Turkey and massive civilian casualties this is what we're talking about chemical weapons because this is such a difficult strain that might be one way that I side tries to actually you know speed up this conflict but you know Turkey has been containing the refugee problem in keeping it out of Europe and I think if we see this major offensive you can start destabilizing Europe again whole new refugee flows in crisis we haven't seen a couple years and I imagine that would create new tensions in the US Russia relationship because we want to see any of that absolutely people don't realize the impact refugees can be refugees for decades when save take that path I wanna thank you very much the long Goldberg thank you for joining us thanks for having me", '2t-88javFZU': u"good evening and we begin

N. F. treaty signed in nineteen eighty seven which could collapse in that in over the next year because we believe the Russians are cheating and they claim we are not following the treaty quickly should the U.

considerable notoriety in over one point three million Twitter followers by speaking her mind without borders except maybe on matters of walls and immigrations concert of Conor commentator Ann Coulter joins us from New York City and we're such a contrast up here about we're opening our doors to Syrian refugees other Middle East refugees the the president you support is banning or pausing immigration and refugee arrivals what do you see as the effect of these sort of twins solitudes on the relations between trump and Trudeau in the longer term is going to be a border price to be paid well you got a lot of catching up to do in Canada me Canadian immigration policy for decades has been more like what trump is suggesting and that is looking at immigration as any other government policy on what's good for the people who already live there for fifty years America has been taking the poorest of the poor the most backward dysfunctional cultures and a lot of work out trump elected was people saying okay that's enough American needs a little me time now we have our own veterans our own elderly our own for people in fact our own immigrants who came in the last decade in the decade before that in the decade before that which is why the trump administration and everyone else keeps referring to it as a pause this isn't hatred for the rest of the world it's it's having a pause to take care of the people who are already here okay but but so conservative you down there of Canada we have you know our prime minister's tweeted about us being at open arms to refugees after the president's pause in immigration is that going to cause us trouble do you think I'm sure while working on what happened to America for the last fifty years and what's happening in western Europe right now I might say would cause some trouble by you got about five decades of total open borders to very different cultures from your own before you're going to be any place where America is because that's what we've been doing for fifty years and now I'm I would date we have had an awful lot of immigration over many decades here ram but let's talk a little bit about nothing like ours well we put a bit from more Syrian refugees and last year than the United States did so we're we're pretty immigration open and and certainly for fifteen years old and yeah now we you took about two hundred and long we took millions for fifty years we've been taking more than a million immigrants a year ninety percent from the third world you guys got a lot of catching up to do I'm fiber Canadian I wouldn't say that was one of America's best policies I'm not recommending you emulate it but I'm just saying an hour the sudden rush under true now you're you're still way behind us I'm curious what you thought about Donald Trump today's call to the Australian prime minister he there's talk about this refugee transfer agreement that continuing Republican John McClain era for John McCain rode to the rescue trying to calm it down after this phone hang up does does your president in some ways need a lesson in diplomacy one of five eyes ally as an ally is on the line I'm well I'm waiting to see what the real story is on that I keep getting one version from the media and then twelve hours later that didn't happen at all I mean we just got it with the Russian sanctions so I I haven't seen confirmation maybe it's coming across the transom now from either the the Australian prime minister or trunk that there was any hanging up but as for the policy being discussed I guess yeah Australia takes these quote refugees I II people want to come to a first world country and live off its taxpayers Americans for being part of the election was saying no we want to take care of our own and and we're not talking about people and I mean as I rose my car in my column this week there are a lot of misnomer is in this refugee business on my own on the idea that that you know we're taking in people were fleeing in the modern equivalent of the Holocaust no I mean even in the New York times examples of their most sympathetic cases we had one in a rocking with respiratory problems and diabetes was returning from Iraq after fulfilling his duties as a provincial weed or over there they're they're not swinging something they're coming here because I got free health care free food free housing which is fine we're a generous nation we've been more than generous but what about the point of saying we gave at the office okay but you talk in Australia a very strong ally of the United States a member of the five guys security blond brow and air your present hangs up on the guy because he wants to keep an agreement going is isn't that diplomatically toxic well for one thing I'm not believing that he hung up yet as I say I suspect that is fake news I love Australia I love Canada I love Britain I still don't want to be taking on more than a thousand for people who we have no responsibility to I mean what the in this immigration scam always runs on me as well for one thing Americans and Canadians big heartedness but particularly in America we're supposed to treat foreigners of it as if they're American blacks will know we have a special relationship with African Americans in this country because of the legacy of slavery and Jim crow what did we do to the rest of the world we don't owe them and yet they show up with a lot of needs and a lot of grievances and this is been going on a very long time we just need a little break for a while otherwise there's gonna be no life boat to put people walk do you think this is temporary or do you think this could be permanent in some cases I think it's temporary though my idea of temporary what I would what I would like it to be maybe a little longer than yours no we do I mean we need to assimilate the ones already here we need to dust off the books we need to figure out serious vetting procedures I would also not only vetting for is this person likely to shoot up the St Bernard you know community center but vetting in terms of did it should we really be moving these people out of the country I mean you could also hurt other countries around the world by taking you know the people that they need to build the country back up again so we yeah I mean one genuine refugees what we want to make sure it

S. missile defense systems was in the Cold War era and the initial idea was that the U. S. could build some sort of giant shield that would protect against all the Soviet missiles that might have the U. S. homeland that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies but after the collapse of the Soviet Union the U. S. reoriented its missile defense program towards rogue actors such as Iran and North Korea kind of giving up the idea that we would be able to protect the United States against or you needed to protect the United States against a full blown missile attack and instead focusing our efforts on could we shoot down one two three a handful of missiles that are coming from North Korea at the United States put in is is saying that these new missiles that Russia is developing would be able to penetrate US missile defenses there's no way that US missile defenses will be able to fend off a full scale attack from Russia anyway Russia has thousands of missiles including intercontinental ballistic missiles they could launch more missiles than we have interceptors the way we prevention full blown conversation like that with Russia is by having a nuclear deterrent the star flipside of are we in a new arms race is what is the future of arms control are we going to be able to come up with a new agreement with Russia are we going to be able to build that trust and have a diplomatic power to get there and right now there's a big there's a big question mark over that", 'HU3fyOSyg28': u"some of those boats and folks will get back in place today because yesterday the weather was so bad from those thunderstorms that were running well ahead of Alex will today Alex is concentrated in a bit more into the western Gulf you can see the bright white clouds in the cover at least half of the Gulf of Mexico there in its size it's a large storm but not a very strong storm so as it makes its way in when it's somewhere around midnight to about one two o'clock in the morning it'll throw some very heavy rain and that will probably be the legacy of this storm the very heavy rain we're talking about two three four inches of rain easy there will be some places that will get up to fifteen inches of rain but that goes all the way from New Orleans well over to Brownsville Texas and down on the Mexican coast line as well windows are likely to be thirty to sixty miles per hour but here's the better news on what's happening so the spills own is right in here the waves will be bad probably seven to ten foot waves but most of the really bad weather is gonna be focused into the western Gulf today and not right on that area with those powerful thunderstorms were yesterday again tightening up during the powerful storms a little bit more to the west today Elizabeth all right thanks so much Sam let's turn now to our correspondents on the goal Fran is is in the storms direct path on south padre island Texas and Matt Gutman is in Gulf shores Alabama monitoring the oil cleanup efforts let's begin with Matt Matt this giving as we said his ground to a halt booms are washing ashore the controlled burns had been put out how long will this essentially have ground to a halt this clean up after that's going to take days was within as you can see the outer tentacles of hurricane announcer jamming these waves are short and with each new wave we see more of this oil washing up now just yesterday there were hundreds of clean up crews right on this beach they were screaming and scooping up the oil and their job is made much more difficult by twenty five mile per hour winds are whipping that wind right in their faces it sticking to their scans that also that women and the six foot seas out there read that thousands of votes this morning are sitting idle those are the votes are laying out the blue skimming the oil it also means that between that oil out there and the Gulf coast there is nothing protecting the shores the oil keeps pushing off here and it means two things one that the oil can be dispersed and chopped up by the winds and the force of that sort but the other major concern Elizabeth is it bad wind will drive more of that oil into the sensitive marshlands and of course the back bays in the bayous here along the Gulf coast I guess the only hope at that point Matt is that rain perhaps falling from the storm peripheral rain might help rinse out those marshes hopefully that's the case but because as marshes are so absorbing the concern is the oil would you stick there and cleaning it becomes nearly impossible all right not gotten and thanks so much let's turn out a rhino and who's in Texas and south padre island where a disaster has already been called for that area right Ryan and good morning Elizabeth as you see we already seeing some significant wins here this the leading edge of the storm landfall SEM talked about not expected here until late tonight and the land fall will actually be about a hundred two hundred twenty five miles south of the U.

immigration reform package in recent months my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform based on these discussions we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise one where nobody gets everything they want but we're our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have near the four pillars of our plan the first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship four one point eight million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age that covers almost three times more people then the previous administration covered under our plan those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a twelve year period the second pillar fully secures the border that means building a great wall on the southern border and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe crucially are planned closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release the third building in the visa lottery a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill merit with the safety of American people it's time to begin moving toward a merit based immigration system one that it missed people who are skilled who want to work who'll contribute to our society and you will love and respect our country the fourth and final bill protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration under the current broken system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children this vital reform is necessary not just for our economy but for our security and for the future of America in recent weeks to terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration in the age of terrorism these programs present risks we can just no longer afford it's time to these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the twenty first century these four pillars represent a down the middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system for over thirty years Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem this Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen most importantly these

able to give back to my people I was paired up with Nicolette bean and our initial meeting I wasn't expecting much just because it was really hard for both of us open up to each other but over the weeks we got to really get to know each other and I learned what she was interested in and what she was really passionate about has given me guidance and a more comfortable feeling with the fact that I'm going to not be in high school anymore and I'm going to meet new people and being in the same I myself don't necessarily identify as native American but just being around this family and so does it make the five home it makes me feel welcome that makes me feel like I'm a part of the group it is driven by led by organized by and animated by students that also is a reflection of the of the

faculty members as well giving back is nation building because it encourages students to strengthen the ties between the university of Arizona and reservations what's compelling to me about native

of Christians around the world that's according to a study by the pew research center over the next four decades questions will still be the largest religious group but Islam will grow faster than any other major religion and make up thirty percent of the world's population we're joined by Conrad Hackett associate director of research and senior demographer at the research center to help us break down the study Conrad your study shows the religious landscape in the world is changing and a very rapid rate relatively speaking give us a snapshot of what the trends or and what's going to happen by twenty fifty well the biggest pattern is that well Christians are the largest group in the world Muslims are growing fastest twice as fast as the world's population about twice as fast as Christians who are roughly keeping pace with global population growth and in the decades ahead eventually we think that if we go out a little bit beyond twenty fifty that Muslims will eventually out number Christians we get to about the year twenty seventy five or so it's very interesting we have a graph that shows that we want to show gives a little bit more detail about the population growth it shows as you were saying about Muslims the only major religious group projected to have that increase at a faster rate Christianity is number two but it's so far down when you just look at the graph itself what exactly is happening with the growth rate of Christianity itself Christians are growing rapidly in some parts of the world but in Europe for example which a hundred years ago is where two out of three Christians live the population hasn't kept pace and in recent years there been more Christians dying then babies born to Christians in Europe in particular as this kind of a geographic shift away from Europe and towards Africa in particular and Asia Pacific were Christian populations are growing and the growth in those other regions is why globally Christians are outpacing all religious groups except for Muslims as far as growth goes so it's a mix of of decline in some parts the world western nations as a share of the population but then growth in the global south one other interesting factor here in this study has to do with conversion from one religion to another and held that kind of factors in tell me a little bit about how you calculate conversions and out what religions are growing in terms of converting yeah we look at survey data where people tell us the religion they were raised in in their religion to day and there's religious change in many different directions but the biggest pattern in the seventy countries where we have such data is that there are a lot of people in these countries who say they grew up Christian and now no longer identify with the religion and as far as other religions go there's movement in and out but the biggest movement is is from Christianity to the ranks of the unaffiliated the or and or the nuns a yes yes or anything very interesting and I know that you guys will continue to calculate this like I said for the decades to come Conrad Hackett pew research center thanks so much for talking with my pleasure thank you",

because it's not easy to admit that you've been taken by a con man now during the campaign con man trump said this about the high cost of pharmaceuticals and we're gonna get drug prices so far lower than they are now your head will spin that's right he promised to use his deal making super powers to to get the drug companies to cut prices but after the election he sat down with the executives of big farm I want to get out it turns out the solution isn't to get tough at all it's to cut regulations he promised the keystone pipeline would be built with American steel it won't he promised to be the savior of coal miners but here was the headline last month drums budget slams West Virginia I know you're real Americans hate being called stupid but they got to meet me halfway and stop being stupid I mean I would say trump was a used car salesman but with the used car salesman at least you get a car with trump you don't get any car but you definitely get taken for a ride he he promised and I quote we're going to have insurance for everybody much less expensive and much better but when we saw the bill it was a giant tax cut for the rich paid by kicking twenty four million people off their health insurance what a truly novel approach to making health care less expensive saving money by not giving people healthcare is like saving money on your kids education by letting them stay home and watch judge Judy and again I don't want to use the S. word but then you have to tell me how this sounded at all possible you can end up with great health care for a fraction of the price and that's going to take place immediately after we go and okay immediately fast quick believing health care could be way better at a fraction of the cost is so this selling let's call it selling the trump approach to health care was never going to be repeal and replace it was always bait and switch because because that is the home man's approach to everything did I say health insurance for all I meant access they were jurors did I say Mexico would pay for the beautiful wall that keeps drug dealers out and locks the freshness and I met Mexico would pay us back I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall act now and we'll throw in a second wall apps trump has promised jobs you're probably wondering will these be good jobs I'm glad you

begin take a look at how it all unfolded I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two controversy on the campaign trail looking back it would have been better but I simply used a second email account the story breaks on March to twenty fifteen New York times report that former sector state Hillary Clinton exclusively use a personal email account at the state department possibly breaking recordkeeping laws I saw it as a matter of convenience and it was allowed others had done it and it's true Clinton is not alone sectors state Colin Powell also conducting business on a personal email but there's one big difference on March for a bombshell report by the Associated Press six three Clint starter emails any private server at her home in New York that same day trade Gary came to the house select committee on Benghazi subpoenas Clinton's emails we want her email hunter documents that are relevant to Benghazi the controversy creed major headaches for the Obama administration when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton use an email system outside the US government for official business while she was secretary of state the same time everybody else learned through news reports Clinton refusing to give up our server and on March twenty seventh Clinton's lawyer David Kendall informing the house of representatives they clinch work related emails had been handed over to the state department and the remaining personal emails deleted from the server trouble private conversation about why you had your own server why you didn't return the records when you left the state department and why you decided to permanently deleted when you lose a congressional investigation for ongoing a federal court or in the state department to release new batches of the emails every thirty days with the goal of having all of them released by the end of January on may twenty eighth I could serve proof judicial watch sues the state department to force it to collect all of certain records emails from her time in government on June fifteenth political reports that house Republicans discover new emails between Clinton and longtime adviser sid Blumenthal emails the committee didn't receive from the state department I don't think it's accurate at all to say that the state department is with help that's what we do know is that she was receiving information which may have instructed in inform her policy decisions from somebody who had a financial interest in Libya everything I did was permitted there was no law there was no regulation there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate I've never had a subpoena there is nothing again let's take a deep breath here but she had been issued a subpoena in March on July twenty fourth another bomb shell the Wall Street journal reviewing forty emails of finding the four contain classified information despite claims that she never sent or received any classified information that same day more bad news for the Clinton campaign independent inspectors from different agencies are asking the justice department to determine if the former secretary of state illegally transmitted classified information through her personal server liberal not criminal in nature but on July thirty first the state department unveils nearly fourteen hundred emails at least thirty seven containing information now deemed classified where in your estimation is all of this had it's it's heading towards criminal investigation and August twelfth the email server used by Clinton turned over to the FBI you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account I love it I love it those messages disappear all by themselves my never sent classified material on my email and I never received any on that was marked classified and fox news ed Henry confronting Clinton about white be the server clean to do what but like with a cloth or something but still more reports from Reuters and the Associated Press of classified information transmitted on Clinton's server and on August thirty first another dumped thousands of more emails released one hundred twenty five of them now considered classified my use of personal email was allowed by the state department and it clearly wasn't the best choice I should have used to emails one personal one for work and I take responsibility for that decision and the FBI now invest in the former sector server scandal but what's being done in Congress Illinois representative member the house select committee on Benghazi Peter Roskam goes on the record good evening Sir and what is Congress doing investigation and do you worry that you somehow step on the investigation being done by the FBI Congress is keeping its eye on the ball and that is this we've been charged the select committee on Benghazi has been charged with two things Greta number one find out what happened as it relates to the Benghazi attack and do everything we can to make recommendations so that never happens again all these other issues are important issues they're dealt with by the federal bureau of investigation other investigators the American public is going to make its disposition or its decision about Hillary Clinton as a candidate for president and so forth but the select committee is staying focused on the activity of the select committee and that is find out what happened art she is this sector Clinton is going to testify before the committee she says she wants to do it in public I take it that day you're satisfied having it done in public so right that's right yeah she's coming in on October twenty second that's the current date all right do you intend to ask her about botany these emails or any of these emails anyway relevant to that test more before the Benghazi committee I think they're absolutely relevant because we've got to have a complete record you know chairman dowdy early on in the discussion when when it was clear that secretary Clinton was going to have to come in he went to the ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings member of Congress from Maryland and said look why don't you schedule the the Clinton time when she comes in meet with her team we only need two things we need to make sure that we have every document that we've requested and we need thirty days to review those documents now you know and I know that those documents have not been forthcoming which is why we're in this challenge that we are right now but it is been the work of the committee and the committee exclusively that is revealed this server this private operation or as Trey Gowdy is characterized it so well this this arrangement that secretary Clinton has made with herself all right do you have any suspicion that the thirty thousand deleted emails to once a sector Clinton has designated herself as personal you have any reason to believe or any use good faith basis to be suspicious that that has some relevant information to your inquiry I have no confidence in anything that the Clinton team is saying right now about these emails the past assertions have shown that time and time again and again secretary Clinton and her team have misled people understated used parsed language and been anything but forthcoming so I have zero confidence in the assertions of secretary Clinton up until now

have been planned so much into the valuation discussion especially for tech because as interest rates rise the metrics and the inputs that you value stocks by start to change as an analyst when you assign a target price or level or a buy recommendation to a stock how much of that interest rate pictures playing into your thought process motor and it's definitely obviously a factor and I think what was the most important thing too is about growth in overall metrics in the market I think what's happened right here is that in tact given the secular growth names you're starting to see just transformational growth that we never seen the last call back did you when you look at cloud computing cyber security big data but in terms of valuation your storage does valuations get scratch and

of companies and investors are thinking yeah there certain sectors that are going to be more vulnerable but will continue to be able to put money in spite away in some the other sectors so right now we have more so hard for materials industrials but there are some other conflicts going on as well I mean we heard from LVMH earlier in the week which you can say was part of the reason part of the complex that did start building up in addition to rising interest rates that may be because what we're seeing now because when they came out and they said that China is really stepping up those checks on the border we saw that stock lower we thought Tiffany's lower we saw a lot of selling there so it goes to show that you make one comments like that and we might be lower whether we should mention Tiffany rebounding a little bit today up by almost one percent after tumbling ten percent yesterday and and one percent gain today is actually a rebound given how much everything else is out but I think it's interesting to see the rally that we are seeing in longer dated treasuries and I'm looking right now at the biggest three day drop in treasury yields with a thirty and the ten year treasury since may so I wanna know Luke does this mean that really it's a kind of ballast people are gonna go back to longer dated treasuries yields will go down the people feel safe going back into stocks and we'll start over again I I think what this scenario does do is it kind of it takes up a nightmare case a little bit where everything's getting hit at once so the least some kind of cushion you've heard people talk or start to bring up the notion of the the fed put again and have seen kind of your twenty nineteen calendar odds come in but not substantially non away one from you know more than two hikes to still more than to hide a little bit less intense pretty started but what I still find interesting is that even though we had tech get hit pretty hard not as bad as the broad market nearly today if you look at the spread we just had the biggest cost twenty five yep the nasdaq's fix the V. accent isn't that much higher so we're in the midst of a solo if you've got the high beta sector that's been the clear winner you had paying on the heels of their worst day yesterday momentum on its worst day ever and get that kind of fear premium intact doesn't really exist yet and considering that they've been kind of a question mark on earnings I I think that's going to be something to watch on the day that yeah that's actually getting above twenty eight almost to twenty nine earlier today in the session that's compares to say fifty back in February and and that was brief because we know what happened with the Vic's not can figure with the whole the only get in yes of course will thankfully all maybe nothing play but a lot of products aren't here anymore so that maybe won't exacerbate it to the extent that we did see in February however even if you look at the individual stock levels that we have seen some crazy back and forth volatility apple up one and a half percent then down one and a half percent Netflix I am the their trading ranges have been three times that's size so if you look down on the individual level you can just see that it looks like investors just aren't quite sure who are the winners and who are the losers here and we are seeing a back and forth a push and pull of people try to figure out where they should actually be position going for is if rates are an issue if this trade deal with China is still an issue what what really benefits here what doesn't", 'Zjbq-KlmcJk': u"trump is always made it clear he absolutely hates the Iran nuclear deal the fact is this was a horrible one sided deal that should have never ever been made when he pulled out of it three months ago he said Iran would suffer we will be instituting the highest level of economic sanctions any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States rom will no longer be able to buy American dollars it would be able to trade in gold aluminium steel also on the list as is the country's

thing around the country this is been ongoing since December and January and and the government has very limited tools to really protect itself from the domestic instability of course they can always cracked down up but they're in trouble and and this is going to be at a tough period for them this is precisely what Mr trump once he says the nuclear deal did nothing to curb Iran's behavior around the Middle East its support for militant groups in Lebanon and Gaza its involvement in the wars in Syria and Yemen the new kit is other partners the Europeans Russia and China a desperate to keep the deal alive they still think it's the best way to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons what can they do there is very little that the Europeans can do I had to say that chasing away so the governments are standing together in solidarity but what they are not able to do is come pal international companies to maintain their presence and visibility in Iran so many European and international companies are withdrawing from Iran tech themselves from US sanctions Mr something's wrong will ultimately come back to the negotiating table and I have a feeling that we talk to do is

will see an unlikely savior in the fight against hackers insurance companies the next year I think one big change will be lot small companies will start taking up cyber insurance so like any other kind of insurance if I have home insurance I choose to live in a flood plain it's going to cost me a lot of money insurance is not a sexy topic the reason the hacks keep happening is not because we don't know how to defend them that we don't have the right technology are now there's not always the best motivation for them to fix the issues in a timely matter we should care about cyber insurance because if they're expecting things to get better if they want organizations to take this problem seriously insurance has the best chance of being a lever for improvement and has incentives so when insurance company tells their clients that you must secure the data like this and they will or their premiums will spike that's how it's gonna affect the everyday person the cyber insurance can only go so far when we all becoming vulnerable to attack more and more of our everyday lives are being hard wired to the internet from the lock on a front door to a heating being connected may bring convenience but it also makes our homes and our personal lives more vulnerable to hackers I think next year you might start to see it become a source of water cooler talking point the more the hacks happen when people get used to the idea of that increasingly everything in the world is computerized might even start to be a backlash against this idea and people saying well why we need a computerized rage right we need my toes to talk into the internet there was a casino in America recently with big data by hacking into an internet connected fish tank and then jumping from that to more sense to bits of the network the company said on taking security seriously now are gonna come to regret it in the future the future for the cyber threat beyond twenty eighteen is more than just privacy and monetary loss before somebody would break into your bank account or assume their identity and steal your money national transport right away controlled by computers now the signaling systems of the people use on on motorways and so on a lot of this infrastructure is is connected to the internet now with connected cars connected energy grids connected case makers for everything in life is going to be connected to the internet we suffer the very real risk of loss of life", '5op0lRgIWO0': u"back in June president Donald Trump called for a tougher US Cuba policy I am canceling the last administration's completely one sided deal with Cuba as promised to the trump administration has unveiled several changes that will affect American to travel to Cuba visitors from the United States will be required to tour the country in organized groups leaving certain Cuban hotels and businesses off limits to Americans the policy is not new but instead reflects prior US policy before former president Barack Obama ease travel restrictions to Cuba in twenty fifteen despite the changes diplomatic ties are intact and embassies in both countries will stay open trump administration officials say the move is sending a message to the Castro regime channeling money away from the Cuban military and back toward the country's private sector on the streets of Havana some worried that the latest decision might discourage tourists and be counter productive I think if anything the band the relationship soon and and let young people like Charles yeah this guy this guy is he's an excellent guide and it's really helped us understand you know what's going on in this country and that's that's I think I'd be done more open to specially to Americans the trump administration's

so we had just kind of parked right outside of all right about here actually right outside of the garage just where it was covered by the overhang and everything was done with us girls were in the kitchen doing the baked beans in the green beans and just extra stuff and just as soon as everything was done was when that second siren went off most people around here were not come up here everybody knows the sirens go off you get downstairs you get to a lower level I'm a guy in my twenties I behave a little differently I took a calculated risk I am not a typical job one person we all worn outside looking at this thing everyone was taking cover probably accept me let's be honest the entire day I didn't think anything of it check it completely lightly I mean this happens all the time we always get warnings or they're saying a tornado is going to come in or it actually does but it is never hits your home so you don't really take anything too seriously even when I was putting blankets and pillows in the bathroom I didn't take it seriously I just thought this is what I grew up doing you know and this is what my mom and every time there is a warning so I might as well due to I have to protect my daughter just in case and literally when that second one went off I was like thank you god that I had practice that so I'm watching the sky and I see off to the southwest back behind me here this this very dark ominous cloud and it was moving in this direction and I'm thinking god that's going near the hospitals are that's going on the south side of town and that's probably gonna go near the high school and I mean I I guess I was right sadly enough it you could hear the train noise that everyone talks about but then right after that is when are you can feel the the house trying to left and then our tub after two yanks we flipped over and started fly in and there was six of us including our nineteen month old daughter in the tub and we just held on for dear life Sean and Ryan were on top and basically everybody had to hand over our daughter yeah I'm just trying to protect her and she was the only one who walked out without a scratch that's what we've been talking about all day because they're calling for more tornadoes tonight and so I mean not having home to go to not that this is the best place to because we do have a basement but we've got several people who have offered as places to stay in a lot of people have basements December I walk out and assist you find yourself being so picky about where we're going to go tonight because I can't do it again

its high turnover rates rights trouble Fishel's leave so regularly they don't even get business cards anymore they just write their names on a little piece of white board just like get a swipe of the Scaramucci and you're good come out but even though people leave all the time yesterday's news court everybody off guard surprise shake up inside the trump administration US ambassador to be you and Nikki Haley resigning a source close to Hailey insisted she's leaving on good terms for all of you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty and I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one she's helped make it a much better position if you want to know the truth I think it's become maybe a more glamorous position that was two years ago maybe I wonder why but it is I wonder why but it is this compliment brought to you by me to meet when you just don't know when to stop which ones would come inside look at the fun these two having rights exist difference you never see someone leave the trump White House like this on good terms with trump scandal free smiling like usually it's John Kelly who has them in a headlock like could be to try to get them out of the White House text don't fight it go to sleep go to sleep you wake up in two days with a job on fox news com in fact Haley's exit was so normal that it's actually become suspicious people are speculating that Haiti left because she wants to run for president that she's in debts and need some of that sweet private sector money all that she wants to get out before serious scandal comes to light my theory my theory is she left because she had tickets to a star is born at the same time as a security council meeting and you're not not going to see a star is born so she just quit that's what I think happened but none of that matters what does matter is that our president has taken on my president is sad because his ambassador is leaving and of course he said because look at how she represented America at the you went for too long the human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and assess full of political bias what we witnessed here today in the security council is an insult it won't be forgotten United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly and we will remember when so many countries come calling on us as they so often do for those that don't have our backs were taking names dem Nikki Haley does not around content of that C. span kill bill volume three is like I'm holding grudges and taking names were although I will say I don't know if the United Nations is the best place to say you're taking names because everyone is from random part of the world just like all right I'm taking names you what's your name how this one up all right you know what actually I'm giving names all right your job I'm not gonna forget what you did John added to that kind of attitude is exactly what trump wanted for America at the U. when rights America first everybody else lost and somebody who's not afraid to tell other countries where they stand although I don't know if he really completely understood what Haley meant by taking names and that was really the thing I think she did best at the United Nations she got to know the players she got to know China Russia India she knows everybody on the very first name basis and they like her first name basis everyone like it was like trump is impressed that he knew the people she worked with him she knows everybody she works is so impressive it makes me think that trump doesn't know the names of the people who work for you he wants to talk to Jared he just yells bring in that weird guy with the face no not here and the other guy so anyway I'm very fond farewell to Nikki whatever her name is I wasn't taking names the important thing is now we want to know who is going to replace and out of all the people who have been floated there is one in particular the court trump sigh I've heard a lot of them are very well I've heard I would leave I'm giving you the people that no no that Ivanko would be dynamite I think about it would be incredible that does it mean to you you know I I figure because it be accused of not for this even though I'm not sure there's anybody more competent than the world but that's okay you don't enjoy sometimes is watching trump have an entire debates against himself he does as president would we all used to do as kids remember when you play with little action figures and you play both roles me like I like your vine garden all dance number jazz jam the job I know but is not right okay you're right next to this morning on the when will I'm pregnant anyway to her credit First Lady of Annika quickly took herself out of the running for the job which means trump needs somebody else to represent him at the U. N. and until they find someone my suggestion is they just get a giant gold hand with its middle finger raised in the air think about it it's tough it's glamorous and it truly represents how trump feels about the rest of the world", 'izitex1QeOA': u"in the day's other news rescue crews in Indonesia spent a final day searching for earthquake and tsunami victims before that effort officially ends on Thursday the confirmed death toll now stands at two thousand forty five but authorities say thousands more could be buried under tons of mud some ten thousand workers with the help of excavators have been digging through mountains of debris in earth and some say they'll keep going I got a lot of departing I mean we are hoping that we can find more bodies that are buried underground there are many more victims that are buried but what can we do the rubble makes the job complicated even with the aid of heavy machinery we will try our best everyday to find all the victims meanwhile the Indonesian government said it's turning attention to rebuilding those communities more than eighty two thousand people lost their homes in the quake and tsunami in Kenya fifty five people were killed early this morning when their bus plunged off a road and down the slope police official said the bus was not licensed to operate at night and the driver lost control nine children were among the dead pope Francis condemned abortion today comparing it to a hired killing he spoke during his weekly audience in St Peter's square and insisted there's no excuse for taking a life what happens at W. used to own a contradictory approach also allows the suppression of human life in the mother's womb in the name of safeguarding the rights I ask is it right to hire a hit man to solve a problem you cannot it is not right to kill a human being regardless of how small it is to solve a problem when he first became pope Francis argued that Roman Catholic teaching against abortion was clear without him speaking about it but church conservatives have urged him to be more vocal back in this country the secretary of homeland security warned that China is waging an intensive campaign to sway U.

balance of the planet poor and more impoverished it's a short term economic gain the benefits few at the expense of the many deforestation is the practice of cutting down forests for various different reasons but it's fundamentally cutting down trees and leaving behind a vast open wasteland deforestation is most common in countries like Brazil Indonesia and Mexico Papua New Guinea and Russia the main causes of deforestation can be classified into three categories basically industrial uses chopping down the forest to build factories or to build residential areas second one is agriculture so cutting down forests in order to grow for example palm oil plantations agricultural deforestation can also be caused by non food crops for example plantations and the third because it is a live stock so in many places for example in Brazil deforestation is caused by farmers clearing the land pastoral and for council for station can happen on a lot of different scales can be anything from illegal squatting a dozen folks in local village using small rudimentary chain saws and cutting down the trees and then of course on the other end of the spectrum is massive industrial scale deforestation whether bring lots of heavy machinery freed Vance technology and they can go in and and clear for us in a very short amount of time deforestation affects the environment trees of course absorb carbon dioxide and as human beings worn more common dioxide into the atmosphere more trees we cut down the more we can the ability of the planet balance how much carbon is in the atmosphere another impact chopping down forces of course reducing the habitat for animals to live in every year over a thousand different species go extinct around the world that is a conservative estimate big chunk of that happens because of deforestation", '4w-Qv2XLyPA': u"green no recent surveys show Americans are becoming less connected to organized religion but they still believe in prayer so was faith among Americans growing or not here to discuss our Maggie are the end today communications director for the American humanist association and I'm Robert Jeffress the senior pastor of first Baptist church in Dallas walking the well thank you are welcome thank you so much regular recent reviews are people tired of organized religion well I think there are a lot of interesting things about this study notably that seven and a half million Americans left religion in just the past two years an increasing number of people are no longer attending worship services and I think that this is interesting and shows that non religion is becoming more tolerant people are essentially owning their own faith recognizing that faith is a private matter and that they don't necessarily need authority from a pope or church in order to develop their own spirituality so I think that this is a very interesting study and we'll see more of this in the future so doesn't have is what do you think what is it that driving people especially young people away from church or any kind of organized religion well I do not think there is a fundamental shift going on in people's belief systems I think Warren what you're saying is that there is a separation now between cultural Christians and genuine believers due to the secularization of our society I think it used to be that people felt like they had to say they believe in god they had to be a Christian they had to go to church should be considered good people that's not true any longer and so what I think is happening is that people who are dropping away where the cultural Christians that people still attending our genuine believers and I really think that's a healthy thing out not to have cultural Christians I don't think it's that many people were shipping their belief systems I think people feel free to be honest whether or not they really believe in god whether they really identify with the Christian faith and I think that's a good thing not a bad thing you may you may be on to something because I want to bring some of this is to say the two sticks out of the study this is a a study from the two thousand fourteen general social survey but in nineteen eighty three ninety three percent of us were affiliated with the religion today seventy nine percent that's of of you know of fourteen percent drop there but when asked how many people attended regular services the numbers are kind of closer together you see in nineteen eighty three fifty three percent of the people actually attended services regularly and today forty three percent and but here's the interesting thing look at those who pray daily in nineteen eighty three it was fifty four percent today it's nice it's fifty seven percent the only number that's actually gone up so Maggie what do you what do you what do you make of this well another number that's actually gone up is also the number of people who are religiously unaffiliated as you mentioned less people are identifying with traditional religion I think this largely has to do with a lot of the anti L. G. B. T. anti women anti science rhetoric that's coming out of the pope it's that's coming out of traditional religions younger people are getting why they're seeing on this becoming a more tolerant society a more I'm a better society for equality and the support equal rights and if traditional religion continues down this path of negativity and and opposing basic human rights we're gonna see a lot more people leaving organized religion in droves that's a difference what do you make of that well I think I George Barna had it right when he said a few years ago what you have in America is basically three hundred and ten million Americans following three hundred and ten million different religions I think this do it yourself religion for you pick and choose which beliefs you like and don't like I think it's part of the train that people want to customize their close their furniture and they're trying to customize their faith but that really doesn't work if you believe in the objective truths of the Bible I mean you cannot customize your faith anymore than you can customize the multiplication tables if you believe their objective truths that are found in the Bible which I do and I think what Maggie is saying that yes yes people are falling away because of the church's many churches believe in the absolute truth of the Bible but you know Jesus predicted that he said in the end there will be more unbelievers than believers thankfully our religion and truth is not decided by consensus or by polls it's decided by the absolute truth of the Bible Maggie there's something that's another part preacher said once inside you can act like there's not no garbage can't react like there's no god at some point you say there's an objective truth in that exist outside of myself because I don't like something there must be some kind of objective standard that I'm basing that on so what do you say to that that when people say I can make my own kind of understanding and about religion and faith would you say to that well there are forty three million Americans and more who identified as atheists and humanists who've essentially formed a good moral basis system are without god without the Bible without organized religion and they're a lot more people who call them spirits selves spiritual but not religious are these are people who have been able to form their own spirituality and there's nothing wrong with that you know we at the American humanist association support your right to pray support to support the right to exercise their religion as you see fit what we don't support is when government gets involved in religion one government endorses one religion over the other that's the problem we have because the separation of church and state essentially protects both the majority religion and religious minorities and this is what this country was founded on and this is what we're all about and that's a difference your answer to that well my answer is we don't want the church dictated religious beliefs we believe in that but you can't have a separation of faith from tree and here is the real essence of all of this it's not exploring that more people are praying but apart from the objective truth is found in the Bible how do they know what they're praying to the right god or asking for the right things we need to base our faith not on opinion but on the truth that's found in god's word are I want to thank you very much Maggie and Robert Jeffress thank you for my party Maggie RTNDA and Robert Jeffress for being here on on a spirited debate thank you so much thank you you", 'GmBnBJslTv4': u"more on this story we're joined by visual deep way a researcher at the institute for climate economics tormented area were in Paris so it's what's made hundred kilometers south of here we had this freak weather over the weekend here where it was summertime temperatures twenty eight degrees a high pressure system stuck over central Europe is is in creating this strange weather this October yes definitely we have been all of our December kind of strange weather then it's quite difficult to make direct connections between such even so we have been knowing and experiencing seven ladies it's as you know precious because was saying in the region this one thirty and and although and in the south of France for four years so those the Byzantine by them since themselves out not totally new that's but we we know that twenty we will experience more and more with him in and we are experiencing more and more of them arts it is the issue of climate change and there's were Chris Bockman was describing which is the issue of over development it's been twenty six years since so what was the worst case of such flooding was in further to the east of the Rhone valley forty six killed there are around these wonderful men and back then we it was said it was a scandal people had built in flood Larry is are we witnessing the same thing yes top part of the issue is because of how we wait we are building we always experienced exceptional events bets we now know that this is the trend is increasing it's more than twenty percent more in the last sixty years and what scientists tell us is that it's very hard to explain without climate change then the second part of the equation as you are saying is the fact that doubt although developed areas totally watch proved grounds with heavy rain that's yeah so it it's we are even more sensitive so more hazards more sensitive to hazards and catastrophes can be really hot and our local planners local politicians keeping up to resist mean from what you're saying if the new instances of extreme weather on the rise that B. zoning permits have to be changed perhaps can be part of the solution yes I I really think that the main points with any events like this one is that we are talking the lotus do way too crisis is managed at the moment and this is part of the of the question but the actual question is that if it's not just an exceptional events anymore if it becomes like business as usual how can you can we collectively change our habits so Pam it's and the way we build can be part of the of the solution yes video the pre what was your reaction last week when those you and scientists put out that report warning that the overheating of the planet is going faster than we thought actually I was not truly surprised beds I think this is really the late said the last call for us did too down message is crystal clear we are already experiencing climate change it gets material and I think this kind of even some kind of illustration we can expect that's part of it then it would be even worse if we don't act and we know that we have been knowing that for years and so we have really have to do something we still can do something and I think the last box of did did this equation these we also have to start adapting to the to this kind of consequences we already experiencing rejoined the play of the institute for climate economics thank you for first stopping by our studios", 'UlJCrcOs3rA': u"Tallahassee and elements of course the democratic nominee for governor of Florida as well Merrick Gillam welcome back to the show Sir thanks so much check I hope all is well all all is well with actually my my family that I have in Pensacola but obviously lucked out this storm took that took that right turn but let's talk about what you're dealing with in Tallahassee in some ways I I want to say you guys dodged a it a bit but I know years almost serving more as a community helping out Panama City and helping out Apalachicola walk me through the Tallahassee destruction yeah first I got to say that our hearts here my community go out to our friends and neighbors there to the west of Tallahassee Leon county we saw as their community was literally wiped away by water I mean water up to rooftops you've seen all the images you all have shown them our challenge here in Tallahassee was of a different nature it was largely wind and rain and my community we've got about fifty percent tree cover which means when the rain comes in that ground is saturated the wind knocks those trees over we've got thousands of trees down in my community over a hundred thousand about residents are without power we are experiencing a lot of work today to remove debris injuries from from covered impassable roads and we got our utility crews on the line trying to get out power back with store but the truth is is that we're counting our blessings here in Tallahassee we know that it could have been much worse for us and when we see what's happened to our friends and neighbors we really are are far are quite fortunate you feel like you have an estimate of when you feel as if your city will be fully functioning again with power with cleared streets you know being able to reopen schools all of those things when you feel like Tallahassee can be back to work as Monday morning realistic well which trying today folks woke up to cruise really saturating my city we had a pre stage over a hundred utility linemen six o'clock this morning they were out working on these polls I went around and visited a couple today and throughout the day the truth is though is that because the impact to our grid system over sixty percent of the transmission lines were impacted because of the damage south of us our energy line to southern energy was cut off it's important that we get that re establish because you know you can't have too much energy on a grid system more harm is calls and so we got to get that reconnection establish hard to give a hard to estimate at this point I will tell you damage was greater than her meeting her mean we had about ninety percent of our utility back up in seventy two hours we're hoping to beat that but we're still waiting for some estimates to come in when you're going to feel comfortable going back on the campaign trail well I tell you my first job is obviously here is mayor of Florida's capital city I was here man and prepared to help see I was community through the storm I'll feel better when we got our folks back we connected to electric utility I'm utilities obviously it will take some time getting debris removed and that kind of thing but once we get people their power back up will come to we'll get back out on the trail campaigning and how would you assess governor Scott in the administration and and and how they're leading the effort here yeah well my relationship has mainly been outside of our municipal level has been with governor Scott and and and senator Nelson we have been in touch as well with the folks from the White House and everybody seems accommodating our requests we gotta try to keep them down understanding that the request to the west of us are much much greater but obviously everything that we need we're putting in the request and are hoping to get a a good response so I say we're working together right now all right I want you to put your new material had on for a moment when it comes to Tyndall Air Force base you and I you partially grew up in in Miami along a lot along with me and and I think you moved from Richmond heights just before Andrew homestead Air Force finance was a heart was the hardhome center for space was not the heart of the community down there and then enter devastated and it was always sort of teetering on the list of whether they were going to close it and then it gets decimated and they never really fully returned I think there's a fear that somehow because of the devastation attend all that this could become an excuse to you know shut down another base you know Florida's got plenty of basis will be the argument perhaps what are you going to do if elected governor to save tendril well first of all I hope that thought is not a serious one at the federal level attend plays a an incredibly important role not only to our national and international security but to the economy of the western panhandle of the state of Florida you've got a whole community that is grown up as as as a military support arm if you will the schools are feel with students whose parents are public servants and really given their all for our country honestly I hope we're just prognosticator and that that's not a real possibility I'll do everything that I can't as governor to defend ten bill as an important instrument to the national defense of the United States now one last question that was it there's been a debate in the debate that has sparked inside both the Democratic Party and a little bit between the Democrats and Republicans which is the famous line at Michelle Obama said when they go we go high and Eric holder the former Attorney General said you know what when they go well we got a kick on and and there's been this back and forth debate where do you sit on this beating Democrats need to fight harder or do you still is ascribed to the Michelle Obama line of when they go low we go hi well tell you quote my grand mamma she used to say never ever wrestle with the P. a you both get dirty but the pig likes it have a tried to describe that a mile political life in in in in and I realize this is a serious conversation for some but quite frankly at this time with okay so get a letter saying we still work totally understand Mister mayor thank you for your time good luck everybody there and obviously we're we're all we're all thinking about the big man communities down there thanks Sir we should note

information the new information as the storm is strengthening continue to strengthen as we get closer to a landfall sometime this afternoon on the bottom line here is the panhandle of Florida has never ever experienced a storm like this in their history we are going to be talking about catastrophic life threatening damage storm surge and hurricane force winds in excess of a hundred and forty miles per hour for a duration of several hours so the latest update as of five AM it is strengthening it could actually strengthen even more as we get into the next couple of hours as we approach landfall and I mean the storm in the text books here is a perfect looking hurricane all four quadrants of filled out we've got a well defined by this is unfortunately worst case scenario for the the panhandle of Florida already seeing wind gusts in excess of thirty five miles per hour along the coast thirty three in Apalachicola and again we are in six spectacle landfall sometime this afternoon

three to four feet but as we get out northward to horseshoe bay fish creek Saint mark's we could be dealing with a storm surge of upwards of twelve to thirteen to fourteen feet that is above your homes in some cases that is going to be extraordinarily dangerous of the storm surge unfortunately the water push is what kills the most people in these hurricanes flooding is going to be a big concern forty eight inches isolated amounts of twelve inches plus and of course this is going to move north and east ward and could potentially affect areas that were impacted by hurricane force is a

shops they can make restaurant jobs easier and healthy food warm part of we started spice wonder college students live in a college student budget the idea came about because we felt as though we could get some really great meals at affordable prices or both or seven fifty using the technology we're able to be really efficient and therefore deliver that value to this to the consumer as soon as you walk through the door you get your first glimpse of the spice about a kitchen from there you reach our ordering kiosks where you enter your mail from when you place your order to when you get your mail should take around three minutes all of the recipes are developed by human shaft Sam vents and so here we are at the station this is pretty into it and it looks like we're just gonna tap this starts you'll see we have four sections all of them and again gluten free while I ate everything excellent sort of why and how is it different team cook with the robotic at ten minutes to cook with their hands on it so when I had to make the menu made a very broad the station for a lot of different choices I had to apply basically one cooking technique to everything which is roughly Sartain when I try that out I always suggest customizing because you can put your own twist on it and we allow you to put your own twist on it without messing it up what's something that you wouldn't let me add to this fall something I wouldn't let you add to this ball would be our team and they checked me that goes on or to the missile which is what this looks really good to me scissor cucumber salad and then add that on you have the choice of your grains think this is our order spices warm green balls talk with vegetables and sauce to get started a robotic runner picks up the ingredients you selected from their individual hopper the runner stops at the walkable cooking meals and drops off the ingredients the grains I catapulted into a Cup measure behind the scenes the walks are heated by individual heaters that use magnetic fields even though your food gets hot the heaters stay cool to the touch after ball is done cooking in the block tips downward to plate the food from there a cook opted to put on the finishing touches while that's happening in the walk tilts down and is hit the jackpot steam to clean it before it starts cooking next mail all our agents are kept outside of the walks so there's no risk for cross contamination side wall near tribe south central the earlier the before they serve all the wheels are sprayed with a mixture of lemon juice and a little bit of lime juice that really carries the dish has like a really bright fresh in a city that kind of just makes you want to eat more food is definitely good what does the robotic kitchen mean for restaurant workers we design our systems to make them complimentary to our work the robot takes care of our work hot work the washing cooking which enables our employees to focus on the really really great stuff that people do like customer service make him for a walk it's difficult to say if more restaurants will move towards automation the future it's possible the industry will move in that direction giving the operating costs that restaurants to face and how challenging that is what I think it's also really important note that restaurants are really only half about serving great food and the other half as great hospitality and there's a human element that's just really critical it's never going to go away I'm back in New York I just what we created Brittany fifteen minutes to get a salad and most of that was waiting in line so this is just one of the basics out about the menu without any customization and it was eleven dollars and fifteen cents the basics five are seven dollars and ten cents so

general Jack Keane great to have you with us general it'd be it this is this is a red line this is drawn by the president and your reaction to its enforceability and the prospects well first of all he wasn't specific in a statement about what would cause him to react he's ops he's obviously opposing one is about to be a very large scale military campaign to destroy the twenty thousand plus opposition forces that are in live in in the problem is ten thousand which by the way are al Qaeda but the the concern everybody has about this is the three million people that live there and and of the Assad way of war and to put in way of war is actually to go in and use mass bombing campaigns to kill as many civilians destroyer's many structures as possible and therefore drive the insurgents or the opposition forces out of the area and that has worked for them time and time again are concerned stated by all the U. S. officials has been if they use chemical weapons and we will respond I think what the president is is just caution them about conducting another bloodbath campaign where so many people are are are going to die women and children and all those the Russians by the way are fully in support of a Saudi here this is what they did one putting took over ninety days after he took over in Russia he wouldn't check there and use conventional forces up a bombing campaign in Grozny and kill tens of thousands of innocent people that's what this campaign is about it is horrific it is and difficult moment at the present being clear of that the United States would retaliate he wasn't specific in what manner if the US side again uses chemical weapons how reliable is the judgment on chemical weapons how bad how do we Howard how confident are you that we have the ability to make that determination without a doubt no I'm confident about it and we've we've been accurate at every time to recall that you know follow on and tions have come up with the same answer we did in our preliminary analysis so he'll any airplane it takes off in Syria we have full visibility of the thing running down the runway muscles where it goes and what it does we have absolute visibility of all of that and was so something those over a town and drops bombs were watching that and then all of a sudden within minutes or let's get a thirty minutes on our hearing that this chemicals and splashed all over the people there so we we know who did it we have their fingerprints on it so to speak what's your judgment will the president's threat to be sufficient to forestall such a humanitarian catastrophe no no it's not going to happen listen that the reality is the Russians and the running so propped up decide regime successfully the we squander the opportunity to do a lot about that during the Obama administration we don't have a lot of leverage to be be Frank about it Lou at the Turks of move some troops down into northern Syria to try to do char them but dead dead set on doing this the Russians a move thirty six additional airplanes into their field they've got is like number of of ships outside W. some cruise missiles as well they're ready to conduct a massive campaign here and and it was going to be awful to watch and more much more awful to experience certainly it'll be horrific like we saw like we've seen and an eastern Ghouta and also won a level general Jack Keane as always we appreciate your analysis thanks so much", '45FzhIkPMKU': u"next guest is Scott casket of the inside higher at to talk about Asian Americans and affirmative action welcome Scott thank you so you want a story this week about a brief filed in an upcoming Supreme Court case that challenges race based admissions at the university of Texas out what can you tell us about this brief in in when white stood out to sure the brief stood out because this was Asian American groups opposing affirmative action in past debates over affirmative action off they pretty much all minority organizations have backed affirmative action and here you have a number of Asian American groups saying that they believe Asian American high school students are discriminated against in the admissions process okay and and does the the evidence show that I mean from what I've seen in places where affirmative action's been eliminated such as out in California it's been a boon for enrollment declared the most selective college colleges in the U. S. well there's there's evidence on both sides there is evidence that all things being equal Asian Americans tend to need a heart your SAT or ACT scores or higher GPA is to get in to very selective colleges bought there they also appear to have need to have high your educational credentials than white students so the idea is that any displacement of Asian Americans is because of affirmative action I would argue that's not yet proven but there's something going on in there competing theories about what's going on so you said that there is some evidence that schools hold Asian applicants to higher standards will on average if you look at the SAT scores that are available are the averages save for a leak colleges you'll see Asian Americans how needing seeming to need higher SAT scores higher GPA is to get in than than white students in addition to that other minority students so that is cited as evidence by critics of any consideration of race that something's wrong with the system the difficulty here is that when you're talking about selective college admissions and we're talking here about the the very talk private some publics we're talking about places that reject all huge numbers of highly qualified applicants sure sure but and and and one of the things that jumped out at me about the story is the focus of affirmative action policies so often is on white students and blacks and Hispanics students and not Asian the impact of nations is often overlooked but a lot of these highly selective schools it's pretty much a zero sum game here for the freshman class that can only be so big and to the extent that some kids are being given an advantage for whatever reason you're necessarily putting other kids at a different and and a disadvantage are you arm that that it's true that at these highly selective places it is a zero sum game where there's more debate is is affirmative action the culprit in terms of Asian Americans not getting in or might it be other preferences might it be our preferences for alumni children might it be preferences for children of donors might it be preferences for athletes so it and and because most sold the most selective colleges have what is known as holistic admissions where they're looking at a lot of variables and there's not just a formula it is difficult to prove", 'l8jKnnxq0fE': u"well here's a look at today's moneywatch headlines in one month will step down as chairman of test was bored as part of a settlement with the securities and exchange commission to test the CEO was accused of misleading investors after controversial tweet last month where he said that he was thinking of taking the company private that's low will be forced to pay a twenty million dollar penalty and my school paid twenty million dollars as well to settle the fraud charges but this is important to remember must will get to keep his job as C.

Angeles San Gabriel hotel and let me tell you this place has some amazing technology you've seen by the way this place is all brand new so you've seen this right you know what these are the luggage cart will this pretty much steps it up a thousand not just because they have robots that take your luggage to your room robots that lead you around the hotel and robots that can deliver room service and maybe in the past you've seen those little room service robots that are kind of small they might fit like a bottle of soda and they're no these are amazing gotta check out so the first row by here at the hotel is this is called a way finder so you literally you know it's at the entrance of the hotel you say were you want to go let's go to their new steak house can I take you there now yes so this robot will lead me to the steak house and you can see this a pretty sizeable robot so it says please stand clear five feet in front of me while moving so someone wants to get in front of this robot it will definitely stop now here's the really cool part about this robot because you're following it not only is it gonna take you to the steak house it's also go over here since I nor the says it's also going to open these doors wirelessly so here we go let's see if it sends a signal to the doors where that so not only that lead me to the steak house thanks robot now I can go right in and place looks pretty good so I'll have to check that out later alright let me show you the other robot over here this one is going to deliver food to your room let's walk over the long walk see that's why they've robots to do this all right so Fred is gonna open up this one this is a room service robot so you know normally have someone come to room bring the food well this one watch S. inside you've got spaces for your food and you just pull your food out when a call your room when it gets there pull your food out bring into your room leave a tip inside if you want I don't know maybe the robot will take it and then you close it up and it will be on its merry way thanks friend all right now these are these robots are called tug robots and of course your first instinct when you see one is to step right on it and take a ride and guess what that's why they have this sign right here although can support you you're not supposed to stand on the thing and the robots are sleeping I just re charging right there still of the find their way around by you know by themselves okay here's the cools robot so this is the third type of robot they use here and this one is the luggage robot so here you go all right here you've got what looks like a luggage cart is kinda reconfigure to say on that tug robot and we open the door you can put your luggage inside right there can fit a bunch of suitcases it's all secure so you can see you've got the lock on the outside and when it comes to your room at all actually ring your phone tell you that the deliveries there and I'll give you a four digit codes that you can unlock this yourself so if anyone finds this in the hotel what's making your way making its way up your room you're not compelled opening that's nice and secure and of course if you happen to get locked inside which you shouldn't position before around inside you can open it up from the inside now I know some parents are gonna requested their kids get taken up to the room inside this you cannot do that that is not an approved method for these robots yet although if I was suggesting that I take taking along route like up every single floor but we're not doing that okay so we close that and now the robot you can see they have this cool they give it like a personality and if you notice it does not have a name just yet so the Sheraton is going to do a contest to name this so keep an eye out in the comments I'll put the link if you want to maybe win something by name in the sky and all the sensors are in here as well so let's fire him up and I'm we've got we've got the we've got several robots passing here it's like a it's like a airport runway so this guy is stopping you could see when they come through they go really slow because these are heavy machinery you don't want to get in front of one of them but if you do all say what happens doesn't it just feel high tech in here with these robots I mean that's part of the fun of seeing the stuff yeah let's let's fire up so now once you get all your luggage in there the front desk will key in your room number and it will make its way up all by itself so let's let's fall this guy now don't try this at home promise step in front of the robot and see what happens okay here we go thank you for stopping all right so let him get on his way and you can see what you get in front of him he's very cautious about his next move because these are very friendly robots and you see is a lot of people moving so they have to be very they've got to be on their game with the sensors so here's what he does he makes his way over here they are the regular guest elevators this robot is gonna take a secondary bank of elevators that are around the corner here so he's going to go that way and here's what the best part about these robots are the service people up front you know the the bell man all those people they will still walk you to your room but now they have the freedom to interact with you and chat with you while this guy is doing all the heavy lifting and all the hard work so less waiting for them and you know you still get that human interaction so I think this is really cool this is the first hotel in the nation to have these robots and so of course when people come to the hotel that's like a bonus it's like an add on you get to take pictures with this thing I'm sure people post maybe I'll take a selfie with him real quick if his mind here Hey you mind if I in his own name yet so I can't okay let me take a selfie okay NEC he's open the door so he's got work to do thanks so much for watching if you like this video go ahead and give it the thumbs up if you learn something from it share it with your friends on Facebook I love when you guys watch these videos and comment on them you have any

S. gonna announce the the for their tariffs in on the rest of the imports from China and could happen late this year our earlier next year so over role that I think could this direct impact from this the tariffs and and reduction in the export gross and on Chinese economy could be ranging somewhat fifty two hundred basis points but obviously we also have to consider an indirect impact and as a result of you know these trade tension between the two largest economies in the world and the bringing down the external demand and global gross and down the road and also the negative impact particularly to the business community in terms of investment activities and the post of foreign direct investment and also the domestic investment in the face of his rising and such and his intentions are you already seen that impact in investments because some of the data we see various economists strategist will say part of this is just the cyclical transition in China the economic slowdown that was already under way can you at this stage pinpoint and say this data weakness is down to the trade tensions I think you're absolutely right actually in the trade tension the negative impact I think has yet to shown in the economic data and the we are probably likely to see just in the coming weeks one time the release of the September activity data and because exporter grows has been holding up reasonably well and partly due to the front loading and he habeas beds that we see the latest a PM maxed orders really collapsed and that really points to a more visible slow down off the exports to down the road and on the other hand I quite agree that to most of the moderation that we saw was on the back of the government's the de leveraging and pain that in our view has been lasting for about two years already and our credit manager actually almost hopped to around ten percent compared with the peak of around twenty percent in Q. two two thousand sixteen so that obviously was I think the main driver of infrastructure investment a deceleration still watching perfect click here to watch another great video from C.

unless you think you very much for speaking to us can you tell us more about what people in Mexico's capital felt a few moments ago and what's the situation there now short work still recovering from that it works as far as the wrong here earthquake felt in twenty two years in the earthquake of nineteen eighty five it took over twenty thousand people black and also Max over about a million people homeless people in Mexico City every kind and strong earthquakes are a question does he live there are very very scared I might not live in the center of the city yeah that was that day normally if you're earthquake mortgage and you all the credit and all the buildings are taking on the power lines and normally in he when you go outside and you're standing on the street right buildings and power lines you don't you stop here in our state but here's what went on for took two minutes right history almost almost even lowering I mean eight not not directions about out everyone your knowledge and the power went out almost the entire thing you are taking on the tower is now back in most of the city not right now people are all the hearing the after shock at there's a week after talk that it will be stronger people know so they they have calmed down someone will keep on now no Brownback and houses leak but now there's reports coming in from showing pictures from chopper and from what hopped out of places that really were a lot harder here where left the building collapsed here in the city there have been reports of casualties yeah and as far as I know I haven't either because of because of the other parts of the country in the southern part of the country biking the color there it definitely is a lot of damage and now people are hearing and did not meet and on the list here we just seen a tweet there from the president of Mexico and recommending it to saying that people will be evacuated from the hardest hit areas what more do we know about the damage the earthquake may have calls in the southern state of Chiapas for example I'm I mean so far all that I'd seen our buildings are that some buildings that have collapsed or had he gained on like I thought the first time that you love from modern Bob ball where does that feeling of coming in I think a lot of evacuations of more related to what could happen weights are not me on and as I mentioned this is a big earthquake was actually at the work of an average of eight point one and now it's saying that it's either a point your income for such action even a strong earthquake that happened in nineteen eighty

actually building hyper loops because he talked about the idea so if we can do this can be done he could probably orchestrated I guess my question would be and ride maybe weigh in on this one would caught what would comprise getting something done or doing something in this area is it just to kind of you know back some of the on going deep research into the area he's done with an actual product at some point what's the what's the relative need for this anytime soon so first of all I think this is what we all wanted right I think that to watch entrepreneurs are technologists go over and tackle these what I call moon shots with with these aggressive funds and a lot of experience and getting stuff done that's what we've all been hoping for you seen it was Sean Parker who's done a long cancer you saw Brian Johnson the Braintree founder work on something all colonel we don't know a lot about our brains I mean you're seeing this with NFL studies we don't know we all have one we're all worried about productivity not to mention all the healthcare benefits are gonna come out of this this is awesome I wish more people were doing this is this a difficult thing to raise money to do Henry I mean is are we reaching a point where the pitches get so outlandish that investors are nervous about committing I don't know where they are in your link is a man depends but there is a lot of money that goes into biotech research with ten year pay outs there a lot of investors who know how to do that you stage it all the way along it's not like you commit five hundred million a day one so there are eight ways to invest in this that makes sense and I'm sure that they can follow that they'll have to show progress along the way I mean I certainly get why a lot of these kind of cutting edge companies and entrepreneurs Ryan are thinking in this way because I think you can easily kind of it view a day where the fact that we're kind of staring at this small thing in our hand and the you have to kind of communicate in this in written form it basically it slows the process down were falling behind the actual capabilities of the technology but then again you know apple gets rid of of your phone Jack and people freak out so how ready are we Hey look it's all about the experience we live in experience World War and a new economy and if the experience is good people love it if the experience is bad consumers a ruthless and we've seen this in the last month so if we have a great experience it'll go viral everyone on everyone will jump on it and it sort of ties in with some of the things we heard about face this weekend right right right questions of whether you can type with your mind Facebook is talking about its own moon shots and this is a direct brain interface to so obviously lots of folks out there are thinking about it Facebook's example people made fun of Twitter the like Facebook is talking about minded computer melts fake Twitter we can't have editing tweets so forth but this is what you can do when you're making as much money as Facebook is with its core product you can invest money in moon shots that may or may not amount to anything right I think you also you also have founders who have the ability to to stay in and actually go after these moon shots and that's a piece that that we have to consider is when you have a soccer Bergen you have

problem we thought turns out they do a Yale study in the look at the number of illegal immigrants United States is nearly twice as bad as great as we thought could be up to twenty two million I read that last night I I I don't know where to believe or not I like to see this study and actually see how they did it and second of all what was the purpose of the study north curtains eggs when both waiting so well done other so many people you can possibly do anything but give empty but on the other hand regards that's a is that the text you want to take I think it shows even more we need more security we need the wall we need immigration enforcement we finally got a president that wants to protect the sobs in this country he wants protect more pleasant ice agents leading to their job right so I think this gives a present more ammunition to say look we need to fix this border well the it sounds like these are researchers at Yale over twenty five years looked at things like deportation apprehensions at the border visa over stays along with death rates in immigration rates and they base their you know the presumption that it could be anywhere from sixteen point seven million to an average of twenty two million which is a lot bigger than we thought express but how much bigger than twelve million you need to be to recognize I mean twelve things if you even if something more number twelve million that soldiers problem that shows we need more security that shows we need immigration enforcement taken seriously in this country so I'm and I'm hoping the people are the American people are paying attention and they make this known to their representatives Democrats and Republicans then you step up and support this president a lot of cities are tight budget but in poor when they found a million dollars for illegal alien defense fund so illegal aliens can get this elite they leave representation in Portland for free does prize me part of the same place we had office shut down for several weeks shouldn't cause a mayor and or the police department ought to to assist ice office even even ice employees weren't gun carriers there also Portman taxpayers we should have that he had a duty and obligation to protect them but port in with all the problems with homelessness and things going on and those funds got taken straight out of the pockets of farming placement so once again you got a politician to put his own political ambitions had a public safety you tell me the police chief could use that million dollars from the fire department we've put more police on the street more Farman out there to answer call for emergencies but no they're gonna they're gonna fund legal illegal aliens to to help was very nice stage which is going to be a further enticements for more people come to sense where she lay foreign be protective lies in the regular attorney you know every illegal in across the board and we had a report it's their choice they can do what they want to or their money it's unfortunate occurs when you entice further legal entering this country you put law enforcement at risk and people die enter this country today this isn't just about enforcing the law this about women being raped children dying cross that river children and families being put in trunks of cars in back of tractor trailers we seen the tragedies happen when you dangle those curses sanctuary cities protection from mice abolish ice will give you free of a pre attorneys out for your case that entices more people to come this country legally puts more lives at

filled with job killing robots were everyday functions taken over without a need for humans but a new book paints a picture of a I that is far less complicated and not as threatening the real benefit of a I will be its ability to predict taking information we have to make knowing what's coming in the future more certain at far less cost ID Goldfarb is one of the co authors of prediction machines the simple economics of artificial intelligence so yes you simplifying it you're saying it's all about prediction and nothing more that's it so when you think of a I you think C. three PO on the good side this robot that can do everything that a human can do with a little bit off and up or something like the matrix or the terminator that are you truly intelligent robots are and take over the world the technologies that's gotten that have made everybody really excited about prediction today about a I taste is production it's a technological machine learning and a lot of it was invented in Toronto or Montreal or at university Auburn us it's a very nice Canadian history to it yeah and its predictions about the process of filling in this information and so you can think about it as a drop in the cost of production now turns off and the cost of production because normally you would be paying people to crunch numbers at center absolutely be playing people are you be working with machines in the be a very expensive to get it to happen and so if you think about it is a drop in the cost of something then we we have a sense of what happens on the price of the gets cheaper so something's cheap we we buy a lot we do more of it and so is production gets cheaper what's gonna happen is we're gonna find all sorts of new applications for prediction he might have not have dreamed up so the the first use of a I'd first use a prediction machines has been good old fashion production problems you go into a bank you want alone and they predict the likelihood that you're gonna pay them back for your default that's an old production problem might years old roster and semi production of when you're gonna die absolutely right that I'm so so a eyes are doing and they're doing that already but what's happening as predictions getting cheaper and cheaper as refining is a whole bunch of problems that you might not have thought of his prediction that our production right like as medical diagnosis so what do you do when you go to the doctor the doctor takes information on your symptoms and fills in some missing information about what is easy with costs that's prediction that the production process the filling in this information increasingly machines are getting good at diagnosis prediction but even things like Adonis driving our production as long as you recognize the arch of finding new production problem and your point is that the A. I. may provide the protection but we're always going to need the humans to make a judgment about what should be done with this information absolutely so humans need to do to fix ready just tell the machines Hey what what prediction should we make which predictions are useful and then once we have one what we do with it so you need to tell the machine even in one of his good old fashioned addiction problems like how likely is it some is going to default on your loan you need to be able to tell the machine that that's important problem with something worth protecting and then once they get the production this person is only five percent likely to default then you need to tell the machine well does that mean we should lend the money or not so there's the judgment once you see the predictions deleting the letter of that in there yeah so now I understand next week you're going to San Francisco and that a number of companies like Facebook and Netflix and Google are interested in what you have to say what is it that you think that they are most curious to know from you so what we've done is give people a framework to talk about machine learning an AI that allows the technologist compete to communicate with business people and so the language of technology whether it's talking about inference or pattern recognition doesn't really have a business context is in a business sense and business people understand the idea of uncertainty and so what prediction is is it helps you deal with uncertainty it helps you reduce uncertainty that is an important business problem and so what we've done is made the language easier so that the business people the technologist communicate with each other all right thank you so much for being here thank you Abby Goldfarb is professor of marketing at Rotman school of business and is one of the co authors up prediction machines the simple economics artificial intelligence", '-qPiT_x9NG4': u"well despite the global implications that would follow if north and South Korea went to full on war the truth is the Korean peninsula would really bear the brunt of all of this and that's where most of the fighting would take place so we know that the DMZ between the south and the north is so heavily fortified that neither side can just charge in and go across that land to attack the other so if the north wanted to step this up and make it happen what do they do Tom the very first thing we're going to see is large concentrations of artillery and missile fire from the north against targets in the south for example soul which is just a little south of the DMZ what's interesting as those firing positions on the north slope of the mountains the defined the DMZ very difficult for the coalition forces in the south to see those pieces before they are activated so while that firing is occurring from these mountains down here what else is going on from the north the north is going to activate the insertion of special operations forces both along the coasts taking them in by ship or Liza my submarines most likely as well as the activation of sleeper agents that have been the case in the south in some cases as many as a couple of decades identifying targets for these missiles and for these artillery pieces okay this is the US and South Korea is not just going to sit there all of this happens so what is the immediate response if such an attack took place number one is the U. S. navy will increase its presence for example more aircraft carrier aircraft aircraft is what we're looking for so yeah aircraft it's in Japan you have aircraft it's in South Korea you know how these aircraft to go against these firing positions that are targeting the south it's called the counter fire fight and once that's accomplished they will then go after the command control capabilities as well as the air defenses communications air defenses you'll gotta so they can control the Scott Pleasley own this air space above North Korea and and then what happened then I'll probably gonna go after some very specific targets like bridging in the north to eliminate the freedom of movement so these north Korean forces cannot maneuver in their own country all right so if all of that happens obviously you have a shift in the battle the north takes the initiative to start the attack within the south in the U. S. response how quickly does it turn so the initiative is not in the hands of the north but is in the hands of the US and called on what's important realizes the coalition U. S. and south Korean response will be instantaneously however the control that will be over the course of probably three to four days in the momentum will shift toward the coalition and their objective is to maintain the armistice so it's you but you don't think is going to happen you don't always gonna have not not at all I don't I I think the worst case scenario way too high the north understands that the United States and South Korea certainly understand what would be expected mostly limited objective attacks not unlike what we saw before when the bomb those islands unitech this boat off the coast and you you've got it with the north Koreans will go after south Korean specific targets not targeting the United States and try to keep it contained somewhat and yet sent a very clear message

their accounts as a result scene at senior producer Dan Patterson joins us now with the latest I'm gonna start Dan with exactly what hackers targeted at this point so hackers targeted an API that see

page if you want to see how your account looks to your friend or a colleague you can see the different privacy settings there and so I would ask you exactly how what are the steps of Facebook's taken to sort of right this wrong well they've contacted law enforcement agencies they have also forced a number of users to log out and what this does these access tokens make it so that you don't have to log back into Facebook or Twitter or Google every time that you visit the site they make it so that he remembers your credentials so by forcing users to log out it also forces users to reset this access token Facebook is as they said in the past they're hiring up to twenty thousand security professionals they won't however tell us how much these professionals are paid what kind of professionals they are these or if these are outside contractors or internal Facebook employees and they are are working with artificial intelligence to find some of the this nefarious activity as it spread to we know if any of the users information has in any way been mis use well we know that hackers were able to see components of the users Facebook profile page beyond that this is a developing story we don't know if they are able to exploit personal data but Facebook says and they said the call today that they keep the credit card information that you may have stored in Facebook and other very sensitive details those are private and also require the password to access so that information right now it seems as though it was safe ten you know we've been covering the issue the Facebook has had with privacy and security repeatedly over and over again how is Facebook trying to regain users trucks that's a great question Rina and that question was asked of Mr sucker broke on the call this afternoon and he not so definitely didn't answer that question so he said we are working very hard to fix some of the security concerns and there are lots of bad actors who want to exploit our

numerous times his democratic opponent we've not heard back all right so John good to have you with us how do you feel that a limited edition well you know it was called a conversation and I I called the nine conversation conversation we we get asked a bunch of questions we obviously talked about affordability and the cost of living the cost of housing the cost of gasoline in the gas tax but we then had a whole huge discussion about gay marriage and guns neither of which I'm running on neither of which is much in controversy we didn't talk about water which is a huge issue in cal and Mister

budget way behind schedule and soaking up billions of dollars that could be spent building roads and outfitting our firefighters we've got a real disgrace of management in sacramental and Mr Newsome will only double down on taxes our Anna rotten business account me can make this state even worse that is we've got a lot of stories on the on the troubles facing California from poverty to homelessness all kinds of things that along with what you meant yeah and yet California voters consistently continue to vote and primarily sent Democrats to Sacramento and to oversee things in the state capital change how how do you expect to change that you gonna pull back that's going to that's going to change and you know you mentioned the homelessness you know I was in Simpson's call today and you know I'm Gavin Newsom was the mayor of San Francisco and it is really a sad situation there Sharon this is one of the great cities of the world now it's the nation wide leader in property crimes you can't even ride the bart and the streets are full of human waste and hypodermic needles and really people that are just living on the streets strung out on drugs and Mister Newsome's answer is to give people clean needles and an injection center so they can shoot up easier I think we need to treat these illnesses we need to treat mental illness as well as the abuse of of drugs and alcohol and and that's the compassionate thing to do I think people are going to reject Gavin Newsom's so called solutions to the homelessness problem and they want to change in California they want to state that they can be proud of and I think they will have that state when I'm the governor of the state well you've already defined expectations by ending up in this final to and the so called

S. consulate in Benghazi Libya but ambassador Jim Jefferies who serve not only in Turkey but in a rock said today's bombing shows that security at embassies like this one and throughout the region works critical at a time when the terror threat from new well Qaeda linked groups especially is on the rise this is how security is going to work we cannot keep people from attacking us the White House says it is too soon to tell who was behind today's bombing but it can't be emphasized enough how the threat in that region is increasing from Benghazi to Algeria Americans have been under attack and there are very legitimate fears I and that will continue all right Martha thank you", 'y90UkcCifVo': u"at one point three billion people competing for the American dream today the new international reading math and science scores were released and Chinese students left American teens in the dust in all three categories we kept thinking all day of this scene we saw from our journey in China these are third grade students pausing to massage their heads for relief because they said they study so hard and they need to relax in the third grade David Muir and I were talking about it we travel to China together David and Dianne these numbers are a stunning for the entire world the Shanghai star you could call in fact our own education secretary called the results the word the Diane used a wake up call our president is calling for a modern day Sputnik moment to catch up tonight's new numbers reveal what Diane I just witnessed a couple weeks back in China nearly five hundred thousand fifteen year old from all over the world took the test the top five scores in math Shanghai China Singapore Hong Kong South Korea and Taiwan and way down the list and thirtieth the US in science again Shanghai China at the top in Finland Hongkong Singapore Japan and down it twentieth the US and in reading Shanghai China again and the others and doubt it seventeenth the US in our travels to China it was everywhere laser focus on education this public school in Shanghai with the children were two years old by three either at school from eight until four already learning phrases in English and the older kids wondered from Diana if the reverse was true back here in the US now I can say on average Chinese students at ten forty one more days of school every year and with some attending classes on the weekends it amounts to thirty percent more hours of instruction every year to China and now much of Asia firmly sees a future beyond those factories nobody wants to be the shoe manufacturer of the world everybody wants to be in the scientific and technical sex so it's a global turning point the U.

a path to citizenship not just for the seven hundred thousand a hundred thousand so Dhaka individuals for but for broader population of one point eight million people the deal that the president wants would also require Congress to pony up a twenty five billion dollar trust fund for border walls on with Mexico and also with Canada that's according to see senior officials they also want to eight and deal that in this deal they want to end chain migration and the lottery visa program again a path to citizenship for one point eight million people that's come out of the White House let's bring in America sure former Milwaukee county sheriff David Clark sure of good to have you want what do you think of this new deal from the White House of the White House is saying it's a big concession yeah I think it is look these are negotiations and you don't get everything you want we're not going to deport eight hundred thousand dreamers we know that most people know that most reasonable people knowing what the bigger part of this was the ending the chain migration and the visa lottery program and then funding for the wall so you can get three of the four things that you want I think you have to kind of look at that as a win who knows that the you know the Democrats still may balk at this because they've done their heels in on chain migration no funding for the wall and no end to the recently visa lottery program so at least it's showing at the White House is being reasonable in this negotiation and offering something so if the Democrats rejected then what back to square one look knows this kind of stuff that's going on for too long in Washington they wait till the eleventh hour knowledge it was extended the other data and the of the budget impasse but at some point I believe that the US Senate president Mitch McConnell is going to have to look long and hard about this this this thing that the filibuster and maybe and that thing in and so that they can get something passed look they're not trying to steamroll the Democrats they're trying to be reasonable it's the Democrats they're being unreasonable yeah this immigration problem is spent decades in the making making it free seats president trump is trying to fix it the two that's cut to the heart of it too that the president wants he wants to stop it or rather fix a family migration issues we know terrorists have come into this country visa family migration policies and attacked innocent Americans and you know what he's saying is new the citizens will be able to only sponsored their immediate families not the outer circle of relatives what are your thoughts there well I think that's reasonable you know now with the chain migration I mean they're going into cousins and second cousins and boyfriends and girlfriends and that stuff has to stop so again I think it's a concession you can have the debate in Congress and in the American public as to whether or not that goes to far in terms of offering something to the Democrats but in like in a ghost like like I said earlier in a goal seasons you have to be reasonable you have to offer the other side something I don't think that's offering too much but we'll have to see how this plays out in the debate in Congress yeah the present is already set the path to citizenship he has said ten to twelve years in the comments about that are you know it here's the other thing the president wants more U. S. customs and border protection agents at the borders as well as more immigration judges we know that the case so there there is overwhelming in terms with you have to deal with that with the legal immigrants let me get to this part of the deal to a border wall with Canada what are your thoughts there well you know that's good and first time that I've heard something like that offered but the main thing is that the problem is at the southern border if there's a problem at the northern border son something I've heard of in the past but the thing is to seal the border and start with the southern border that's very important here that's really one of the mainstays of what the president during his campaign and then after you became president that he drew a hardline on and I'm glad to see that he's holding the line on that the ten years twelve years fifteen years before the dreamers are eligible for citizenship I think again that's a concession I think that's reasonable that's what you want to look for negotiation you want a reasonable approach to what you're trying to ask for what you can get because look if you can't get a you can draw hard lines on all the stuff you can say nothing for the dreamers deport him you could say note saying migration no visa lottery and a wall is as long as we wanted and that's it that's not negotiating okay that's what is its negotiating with a a gun to the other sites had me like this still share from what I've heard and I'm you know just like you were just hearing that yeah I need to know more details but again it's negotiation and so I think from that standpoint what I'm hearing I think can pass and that's important here to what can pass not what do you want but what can you get past yeah I mean this is been such a sticky wicket for

the problem is not guns and it's not nice the problem is the ideology and there are no long balls in the global jihad they're all soldiers and what is the internet but a means of communication the problem is that she had a doctrine he was yelling Allah Akhbar that was Muhammad's jihadist war cry his last name the way of you watching CNN it was a little different he was witness suspect was yelling god is great in Arabic my own last name was C. fuller which means thought about a lot and I'm sure when he was vetted by immigration authorities they knew that this man was moderate and they

mankind referred only to men and was there for sexist Jeffers joins us now Kelly thanks optima thanks for having me so it doesn't sound this is a debate over accuracy mankind is a real word and you used it correctly it sounds like it's a debate over preference she didn't like the way you used a channel like your ideas and socially penalized with that what happened yes exactly I turn in a paper I hadn't used the word mankind and apparently that wasn't your liking apparently that's sexist and not gender neutral language and I should be punished for that what I find so striking is that she's an English teacher so of course and language is her subject of study and accuracy is got to be a concern for anyone who's teaching kids did she say it wasn't accurate yes she told me that toward mankind only refers to men it doesn't actually include all of humanity does the dictionary say out or is there some authority that she pointed to to confirm that position well she referred to the modern language association or LA and I'm really there and forcing this kind of gender neutral language hi and so you got a point off did you did you say nope I'm contesting this I don't think you should take a point off I mean how do you respond or well I met with her after I apology mark me off and I am how discussion with her very subtle but she told me that using the word mankind was sexist and against women that has it apparently has a history of holding women down in some fashion huh interest we've got a full screen here of of her no to you we put up here I would be negligent negligent she said if I did I also raise this issue gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for general neutral neutral language professor and Scott so her position is this is oppressing people this is a tool sexism this is a theoretical but I'm warning we think of it if you had a student in your class wearing a burqa who was told by her family that she could not reveal her hair in the presence of men do you think professors got would consider that sexist would say anything about she was a thing about it does that seem sexist you telling a girl she's not allowed to reveal her hair to any man does that seem more sexist in the term and kind absolutely I I have no idea why you know feminists are obsessing over a tiny little you know micrograph shins such as how you know or issues

new axioms poll shows otherwise let me introduce you to the deputy news editor of acts heroes Alexi Mick Hammond joins us live good morning to you the mainstream media they've been talking all about blue wave right right right so this suggests that it might be harder for Democrats to take back the Senate there defending ten states that trump one in twenty sixteen and our poll shows that the twenty eighteen election were held today five democratic senators would lose to Republican okay would start in the hot seat Jon tester the incumbents would actually lose the Republican he what and thirteen percentage points he once called the GOP tax bill the worst bill he had ever seen and we've seen in polling that the economy and if your P. tax one is very popular across the state so that clearly hurts him okay Joe Manchin constantly comes on the show and says I'm willing to work with the president but he never dies in the people of West Virginia went for the president in a big way taking its toll this is another sort of that very big gap like tech tester if you'll remember though Joe Manchin was one of the only democratic center is a stand up and applaud that trump during the state of the union but he still hasn't voted with him he had a problem exactly clear macaskill in into a trump person in a trump state and trump has supported endorsed Josh Holly her opponent also in twenty twelve Claire McCaskill was considered a vulnerable Democrat then so this is a little the least surprising one to me and she might be the most vulnerable now there should go Joe Donnelly this is the Mike pence state I'd say and he rode on Air Force One was trying to his home state to talk about the tax plan but you'll remember during that campaign rally trump said if you vote against attacks when we will come back in campaign against you know I think that's what we can expect a really interesting state is North Dakota because they went big for trump and yet the Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is really close to the generic Republican can't this is the most surprising to me because as you just mentioned North Dakota voted for trump thirty six percentage points over Hillary Clinton but now her generic candidate only has a plus to advantage but we should watch for Kevin Kramer who has decided after all he will run again as her and trump has been courting him to run and loves him so I think that could change that I so if the election were held today and it's not going to be the Republican will actually beat the Democrat in six Senate seats in five of the Senate seat but obviously there are a lot of factors that could change between now and then so we shouldn't become too alarmist but I will say that I think the Senate democratic takeover is a lot harder to achieve in

affects the health care sector and it definitely affects the financial sector effective tax as far less I do think that certain things immigration trade B. one B. bees are those are the things that sort of thing but now I think that the tack is cruising along and let's have some huge ad trade or problematic disruption and is that in that might that be one of the reasons the tech really has been leading because people have gotten a little nervous about the truck no that's about everything else act right and if tech keeps going regardless whether we get health care right now I mean though that there's a larger issue on technology for me and not be as you say you're not I don't do the day before it one day things but I'm kind of waiting for the next big break through or innovation I mean you know when Steve Jobs is doing it every three years it was like the iPod the iPhone the iPad things out many I. phone change our lives totally things like uber got to happen doing this podcast on the innovators and half of innovation could have happened since two thousand and eight if you hadn't had things like the iPhone in which an uber and Airbnb or whatever could disrupt the entire cabin Destry disrupt the hotel industry I'm not feeling that form of innovation that we've been talking about on this what they'll Blazers by that point Walter I just wonder if the focus is even on innovation when it when the program is have to focus on what's going to get the most out clicks right whether you're an address on little's full that the west innovation gonna come from if that is the objective of these big companies I think your but your finger right on it which is you used to have multiple revenue streams more easily if it's all going to be aggregating eyeballs for ad clicks then Facebook and Google have got your blown out of the water so it's a little bit hard to do so you've got to create some new innovative some innovation would seem to me that aren't just add driven now you see not abandon over is not address him but I wonder whether we're seeing innovation right around we're missing it for example echo you know that was on an island I love Google that's a real innovation and we have a virtual reality on the horizon we've got artificial intelligence I mean it may just be arrivals cars whatever you know there's always a lot of things on the rise in the sometimes of a Rogers and I keep getting for them for the way I use both hello Google and now I hope you know Alexis and I you know the Amazon echo I think they're very good and they will tie in with physical things I'm not sure that they're they're not that much different than putting my iPhone on the counter and turning on series so it's not a huge innovation in my part one I think driverless

me now from Washington to Jonathan what implications could the president's tweets on nuclear warfare have on American foreign policy I think what they might do is actually contribute to North Korea and leader Kim Jong wounds of apparent strategy to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea because what you have is the south Korean president moon who has been looking for openings to conduct the talks with the the north you have the north offering those talks of which are apparently going to take place next week on the north suggestion that perhaps it wants to send a team to the and winter Olympics in South Korea meanwhile though you have the president of the United States tweeting about his willingness to start a nuclear war with North Korea this is something that would obviously add to the alarm is with the in the news the south Korean government glee with its president president moon because he wouldn't he's looking for a diplomatic out outlet as is the regional power China and other countries what about a wrong the president is also used Twitter to express support for those protesters the anti government protesters across Iran what would you say is the white house's strategy regarding the latest turmoil in Iran but not sure they actually have come up with a strategy at my my understanding from talking to sources in the government is that the United States is largely still trying or has been over the last several days trying to understand the depth and the breadth of these protests a you know how wide they are how deep the disenchanted with the government goes and trying to come up with messaging with coherent messaging that about two to broadcast to the Iranian people meanwhile the president has been tweeting and and those tweets have been exploited by the Iranian leadership as it accuses the United States Israel Saudi Arabia its enemies of being behind these protests and so in a way the president is playing into the regime's hands Pakistan has also been the subject of presidential tweets the president threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan on Tuesday saying the country is not doing enough to fight terrorism yet U. S. still uses the country as a staging ground for the war in Afghanistan what impact will this have on when it comes to fighting terrorism well we have just reported that the White House intends tomorrow to announce that it is going to suspend all security assistance to Pakistan because in the president's eyes and don't forget they've just completed or have been undertaking a assessment of Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts that the Pakistanis have not done enough to go after groups that are based in Pakistan that have been responsible for attacks inside of Afghanistan as well as going after Pakistani groups that the United States considers terror restore gonna stations and so we're expecting an announcement tomorrow by the White House that the United States is going to suspend all security assistance to Pakistan which comes to about I think this year around about a hundred and thirty eight million dollars well what kind of seismic implications will there be a coming from that announcement will have to wait and see but don't forget in the past the Pakistanis have reacted to what they consider you know negative American moves to closing down the two highways from the port of Karachi by which the United States its NATO partners and the Afghan military obtain military goods particularly now mostly the Afghan military gets its goods up these two roads and so there is some concern among some analysts that an American move of this kind could precipitate the closure of these two roads once again speaking of cutting off aid a president trump also threatened to cut off aid to the Palestinians this comes just weeks after saying the US would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital where do you see the Middle East peace process going from here but there is no Middle East peace process right now there is no there are no real there are no talks going on in particular the Palestinians have said that since the the president has recognized it Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reversing you know decades of American policy they are not going to talk they're not going to you rely on the United States as being a mediator in any new negotiations with the Israelis and at this point there is no peace process ever tumultuous geopolitical situation Jonathan land they thank you so much my pleasure", 'QOcnSJD1Jiw': u"Syria's state run media says a U.

on there exactly so all the information on our honor devices need to be protected so there's a couple easy ways you can do it in a lot of it's free and built in the device so one thing that you can do is lock it so you want to make sure that use a pen a password something that strong enough to keep somebody out but not too much you're gonna forget it okay and then you can also use your thumb print now right lot of device are gonna have that were you can actually scan fingerprints and then you can use mortal fingerprints to so if you want to give access other members of the family you can do that as well okay lock and I know sometimes not everybody does that right now but it's very poor because we have a lot of personal information or devices we don't want if you're buying stuff right yeah you have your bank accounts you have you know pictures text messages even your contacts you want to me to be able to get into absolutely I know this is one that I never would think about changing your password you want to do that every once in awhile you know that way maybe somebody knew your password you let him in your phone one time now they can get into your phone whatever so everyone twice to make sure that you can change that up and this is one that a lot of people I feel I do a lot the backing up data yes so when we lock it to make it really secure we also imagery back up so that if we do in the event of something bad happening we can't actually recover all the information we lucked out somebody did steal it you can select your stuff back there's an easy way to do it so if you have an iPhone turning on the I. cloud junction and that actually sinking different things you can pick what you want so weather like it's your notes are your photos contacts that kind of stuff

legal immigrants if they receive government assistance according to the proposal legal immigrants would be denied lawful permanent residency if they received aid war if the government thinks that they'll need aid that includes food stamps welfare Medicaid for housing vouchers is joining me now from Capitol Hill discussed a proposal as political employment and immigration reporter Ted Hassen Ted thank you very much for joining us so as a right now this that concept is just a proposal what needs to happen before it becomes official DHS policy that's right do you just rolled out this proposal on Saturday evening and at this point they haven't even taken the step of publishing it in the Federal Register which is kind of the first thing that they need to do to get the ball rolling after that there will be a sixty day comment period where people can weigh in and interest groups the public can say what they feel about this I'm in after that the trump administration will need to absorb those comments consider them and potentially review the review the a policy before they issue what they call final rule so in the meantime what effect do you think this proposal could have on legal immigrants who are considering enrolling in public assistance programs who are economically disadvantaged in might really need the help we should make one thing clear to begin with and that's that using certain benefits in itself is not necessarily going to disqualify you from getting a green card essentially mold multiple factors are weighed under what they call the public charge statute and this already existed immigration law and to a degree it happens already and people are considered about whether they'll become a drain on taxpayers if they become a green card holder he would just be that under this proposal it would be far more extensive and it would have a much lower threshold for usage of benefits and as you mentioned food stamps welfare section eight housing vouchers all these things would be considered and weighed as factors and could potentially lead you to be denied a green card so roughly were taught we of the US population a quarter of US citizens children are part of an immigrant have an immigrant parents how do you think this will might affect families who have mixed immigration status one of the biggest thing that advocates for immigrants and for people who are poor are are great about right now has is really a chilling effect and it's not so much what this rule will do I mean as I mentioned we have this long comment period many probably won't even be in effect until well into twenty nineteen but just the worry that maybe you could be denied a green card or not admitted into the US at all because you've used public benefits here I think it will be you know have some effect on people and and we've already heard healthcare providers saying that immigrant families are turning down some government aid even though this is not a retroactive rule so once it goes into effect your prior usage of benefits will not come into play most likely employment immigration reporters had hasn't thank you very much Ted for joining us for this important issue

Gatineau regions severely damaged paramedics are on the scene dealing with emergency calls hydro crews are working on major power outages this is still a fluid inactive situation tonight but we have plenty of visuals for you I'll give you an idea just how bad the storm in is let's bring in Johanna Wagstaffe with the latest Joe Hannah well Carol let's just start off by reminding everyone this is still an active storm line so if you are in eastern on Terry or southern Quebec storms roll through your area I'd take cover tonight these are very dangerous storms so just earlier this evening barman

it sounds like we are seen the worst of the damage the mayor of Ottawa actually I've reported in local media and that there are about sixty affected homes in the down robin community viewing images from a drone that the community has just set up of the west Carleton secondary school in dead robin is now an emergency shelter red cross is there and paramedics are attending to injured people there are several reports of people who were trapped in their cars and homes firefighters are now going door to door to assess the condition of everyone but as you as you see these damage features it is truly devastating just starting to understand the the long track of what was likely a very strong tornado wanted to get back to that video again touching down in down robin earlier this evening likely as a a a an EF two on that zero to five tornado struck scale you can actually see some video I think this is just north of gas you know at the end of its track of that rotation and of the debris Carol mentioned at about a hundred thousand customers without our in Ottawa and the storm line as still going strong on top of that heavy rains and hail and this was actually a hard to see storm I went back and looked at the radar is what we call it rained rap so Environment Canada did have the tornado warning in place it would be very hard to see given how dark and rain shrouded in this tornado was Carol yeah I I Peter Campbell I'm a warning I prepared this meteorologist with Environment Canada said we know for sure there was a tornado get no because we have colleagues who actually saw it so if you say it's a line to move from auto across the the river to get no where these storms now so they're now tracking down towards the international border Carol we're still seeing some active weather in the Prescott and Russell area of Ontario and then just moving through Montreal and Quebec City now this is where we're looking at strong winds the main rotation line heading south of the border and in fact the National Weather Service south of the border a starting to issue their own watches and warnings so again take cover if the storms are headed your way as you mentioned though Environment Canada confirming this tornado because of all the footage and personal accounts from their own meteorologist they will be headed out to the scene tomorrow to confirm the strength of the tornado and

trump's racist comments inflammatory racist language the situation that were used to has been completely reversed at this point the guys at the right wing outlet known as Breitbart are furious with trump now terms images loud brash and tough you think you'd never apologize for anything but he recently did apologize for making tweets that were offensive to Muslims I would certainly apologize if you'd like me to do that I know nothing about them it's been over a year trouble starting to look a little bit liberal a lot of the right wing or disappointed and some of the left wing doomsayers are looking a little bit selling you're not having terrible terrible dream usually are going to be remnants of a neo fascist movement if he leads in this country after this election this guy is a complete clown ever Steve Bannon that scary far right winger who is supposedly directing Donald Trump behind the scenes yeah he is not on good terms with the White House these days think the president's statement is extremely clear what his position on Mister Bannon is was pretty lengthy and pretty detailed and there's not really much to clarify or to add if that's in reference to comments made by Mister Bannon I'd refer you back to the one city made previously on sixty minutes worry called the collusion with Russia about this president a total farce we get to really on earth and address this thing called the deep state the shadow government and what's happening right now especially by what's been avenged indicated on on line in the internet rooms like a chant with Q. one on this is going to be the most transformative president for presidency or ministration ever what happened to all of those things that he said he was going to do this it was going to be more aggressive involving

desk but still cover the story at six twenty five AM anchors at local station KTLA tried to protect themselves from the heavy lights above their heads and then they return to report the news the US Geological Survey other Ellie stations were also caught by surprise lotus a big one right now manner station in Los Angeles acres Rick Garcia and Sandra Mitchell or torn between their safety and reporting the news this is the strongest earthquake I've felt on they are here in the studio we have three hundred lights overhead and some of them way up to twenty five pounds believe me if things started to come down I would I would be under the desk without hesitation almost immediately news outlets across LA started giving whatever information they could from their seismographs and you can see exactly how long it lasted were their choppers we were up flying so we do not feel it appearance guy Fawkes obviously at least viewers could see that downtown LA was still standing for many on air and off Monday's early morning quake was a wake up call I think here in LA we get a little bit apathetic and we and we think yeah it's been awhile since we've had an earthquake is funny and then when it happens we just enter action for CBS this morning entries strong there right now so would you go under the desk you know I I I don't know because I haven't lived in California but in that situation very scary but the crew just inform me that many of these heavy like that we do have I'd be very scared of that all of them though do have safety chains so they won't hit you in the head it's okay I'd

partnerships between the government and faith based groups as part of an executive order called the White House faith an opportunity initiative that trump signed today during a national day of prayer ceremony we are proud of our religious heritage and as president I will always protect religious liberty the faith initiative will help design new policies that recognize the vital role of faith in our families our communities and our great country we take this step because we know that in solving the many many problems that are great challenges faith is more powerful than government and nothing is more powerful than god I love them on my truck may often sound like the most pro faith president modern times but gosh there's still much to do here is to discuss river Johnny more spokesperson for the president's informal evangelical advisory group well it was a it was a hot day and the and and outside of the White House there are a lot of evangelical Christians it and people are switched on like how you guys support Donald Trump Miller three times you know all the deals now it's stormy Daniels why does this president speak to the evangelical base today given what's happened well to the religious liberty community I mean he's a total hero but that's what's what he's done I mean this executive order this year was part two you know last year at this very national day of prayer he ordered basically an audit of the entire federal government to determine every single example where the where religious liberty was being violated with the whole cabinet sitting there and this year he sang in a we've cleaned all that up we've been if you know there's a whistleblower element of this executive order saying to the public you see a problem tell us about it saying now we got all that settled so how can we partner together is as a faith community it and doing it in the rose garden steps out of the oval office was a powerful symbolic MNF symbolically I mean just saying at his words him in everything that's going on a swirling around him didn't it did any of you get together to pray regularly with him do you yeah we we we pray with the administration you know all the time we play with him we pray with others and you know the other day a reporter asked me is it true that there's like an evangelical in the White House every day and I said it's probably like twenty five every day in it in it least ten or twelve of them in the west wing and a bunch of them on the captain as well I mean this is a faith friendly administration although he does policy with the words out well although you know he said is gonna help the little sister the poor contraception mandate gonna get rid of that but it's not was there still litigating that I it's so he hasn't given the really meant what Congress has to do some of the stuff but couldn't he with an executive order address that issue and then and probably had to the courts because the fact is that the Obama administration had so up sensibly deconstructed religious liberty across the federal government I mean it took a whole year to sort of anti all of this and I think the little sisters of the poor are are just they're they're gonna fight this to the to the very end because they were taken advantage of by they want you hasn't process again is going to get in there and make sure that that that doesn't happen that they're mandating contraception coverage to these nuns a hundred percent of the time president trump has demonstrated that he is entirely supportive of of religiously reason most pro religious liberty present we've had and so you know I I think when it's when it's all said and done as we've seen again and again and again the proof will be in the policy that's what it'll be you know it then it is the national day of prayer two in this is amazing it for eight years president Obama had a private celebration issued proclamations that this was a powerful ceremony it's great to see you and now we're

his focus again to immigration leaving the door open for a potential new child separation policy but that same poll showing Democrats gaining ground on that issue fifty percent of people saying they would do a better job on immigration versus just thirty eight percent who think that Republicans would do a better job ABC's White House correspondent her primary joins us now live with more good morning terra good morning that's right the president said on the White House lawn that the child separation policy works that it did turn the legal immigration and he seemed to suggest that he hasn't given up on that policy Democrats want to abolish ice and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens just weeks before the mid terms president trump revealing he is not giving up on a zero tolerance immigration policy will look at everything fell but you can look at it when it comes to illegal immigration The Washington Post reporting that the trump administration is now weighing a new version of it well I will say this if they feel that will be separation they don't come according to the post the president is considering a plan that gives parents to cross the border illegally two choices stay in family attention with their children for months or years of their immigration case proceeds or allow children to be taken to a government shelter so other relatives or guardians can see custody we have the dumbest immigration laws in the world the world laughs at us but we're getting them change we need some more Republicans this comes under the trump administration faced backlash for what some are calling a family separation policy more the crackdown ended in June hundreds of children remain in detention shelters or foster care and US officials say more than two hundred are not eligible for reunification will release the department of health and Human Services also releasing new video footage from inside a Texas detention center here the center in Torneo Texas housing twenty four hundred children seen playing eating together and banking in close quarters the two women in president trumps life of longer term them along it from say they are against the child separation policy the First Lady told our Tom Yanis but she was blindsided by it and told her husband that was unacceptable Adrian all right thank you so much terror a lot to talk about the world of politics so let's bring in ABC news chief anchor George Stephanopoulos forty guys that morning to you good to have you with us is always a let's start with the latest uptick in approval ratings for the president a lot of people are talking about it he has seen improvement so what fueling these numbers and the second part of the question is how will voters feelings either positive or negative affect their mid term vocal I think there's two things feeling the presence rise when the economy is doing very well and secondly I think is really consolidated Republican support in the wake of that fight over Supreme Court justice of Brett Kavanaugh I think that's really helped him a unified Republicans by and get them excited again so we have seen an uptick now forty one percent still not great is still in a danger zone for presidents going into mid term most presidents have approval ratings that low going in the mid terms lose seats in the mid term elections but it is on the rise and that's helped when you break down those numbers are seems to be a real difference in opinion when you look at gender women are more disapproving of the president they prefer democratic house candidates in overall there seems to be more of a sense of urgency about this mid term with women what's driving that and how critical do you think the female vote as well first of all this gender gap is as high as we've ever seen employment polling the Jenner get going back to nineteen eighty two it's never been this high going into mid term elections something seem to fall through the did that the last campaign women are generally turned off it's not it's not so much policy or not only policy it's president trumps a character temperament the way he goes about his business and of course the me too movement is fueling it as well we seem to do tremendous rise also in female candidates particularly on the democratic side and this is I think going to be the key thing to watch the selection if women come out in the kind of numbers we've seen them expressing in this poll right now that is very good news for Democrats and George immigration back in the headlines the president talking about it reports of a new possible policy but another interesting piece of this poll fifty percent of Americans saying that they trust Democrats to better handle immigration compared to thirty eight percent for Republicans is the present zero tolerance tolerance policy specifically the separation of families impacting the GOP and is that a negative and what you know it's it's it's a mix impact I mean I think that our poll is writing generally voters prefer Democrats Republicans and immigration they generally reject per as in trump's hardline policies by the presence base loves them and is one of things that gets the most exciting it's the most enthusiastic about going to the polls so I think how it will actually impact election kind of a wash let's talk about a move from platform to the disappearance of this Washington post journalist Jamal Khashoggi is this some type of diplomatic mine field for the president's it's certainly is I mean the president and his son in law Jared Kushner have really struck a strong alliance with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who according to some reports is behind the disappearance of Jamal could show you so far we have heard anything from the Saudis but denials but he he is not merge from the from the embassy it's almost certain that he's dead you see what the president has said right there he wants to punish the Saudis but he doesn't want to take away the ourselves and what is he going to do and is he willing to create a breach in that relationship big question for the president a lot at stake thinking someone and he said he's he would be willing to talk to them about this when you talk to someone in this type of subject matter how careful do you have to be with the language in and you just accept the denial of writing for now the present is simply accepting the Niles a study saying they deny it but the but he's also going to talk to the crown prince himself right now on its face the denial is not all that credible hi there and we have different information coming in from the Turks from our own intelligent the press is going to have to make a decision on this in the coming days Congress appears to be doing some steps and they're very hard well yeah I think these guys are kissing and a reminder this morning George is a big show he will go one on one with White House national

Elizabeth ray she says she was paid fourteen thousand dollars a year and that her only job was to provide Hayes with sex what do you think he would get the money for wasn't a quiet understanding on your part I sure I knew what I was getting the money for St my boss having sexual roulette is very clear yes ray famously said she was hired even though quote I can't type I can't file I can't even answer the phone at first congressman Hayes tonight a relationship all I can say is she was put on the payroll go work from nine to five the same as everybody else she says that she was put on the

were they're the only ones who can afford to meet these regulations there don't know what's gonna have an army of lawyers you know in other words could this actually backfire it make them more powerful not unlike losing with these big banks who gotten too big got even bigger since the crisis there's always a chance that the regulation will take some financing and won't pan out exactly right the first time the eve definitely imposes huge fines and may lessen competition in this space but we can't move for it as it is it as it is with no regulation the Facebook reaches that took place this

but we'll do that after the break let me ask about religion because you recently said the following quote those in politics have an obligation not to wear their fate on their sleeves and a lot of people said how come again Ted Cruz right because you been out there regularly asking voters to pray that god will quote continue this awakening in this campaign you regularly quote from scripture on the stump and you actually told your volunteers that they need to put strap on the full armor of god so how is that not wearing your religion on your sleeve well this is number one this is a point I made for many many years that that that politicians you know they're far too many politicians who use religion as a cloak to hide who they are and I think that's wrong I think you have to be particularly careful against that now I recognize that that that many in the media try to paint anyone as a conservative in what is actually Christian to paint them as some sort of crazy not I'm not gonna hide my face I am a Christian I'm good knowledge it I'm not going to be ashamed of Jesus what's wearing it on your sleeve if not you know put on the full armor of god well let me give you an example what I talk about every day on the campaign trail I talk about jobs I talk about freedom I talk about security I'm not running the pastor in chief I'm not asking you to elect me to be your pastor it's not the job of the president to stand up and give a sermon to evangelize is not the job of the president to tell people you're going to hell that's not a president's job no one wants to see a president trying to do that it is the job of the president to be commander in chief to defend this nation to keep us safe to defeat radical Islamic terrorism it is the job of the president to fight against taxes and regulations that are killing small businesses and destroying jobs be informed by your face look inspired by my faith is integral to who I am but you know the great thing about the bill of rights actually were talking a minute ago about the bill of rights so I've done town halls were people stand up and say I'm an atheist why should I support you know what the first amendment religious liberty it's the very first celebrity protected in the first amendment of the bill of rights it applies to everybody it applies to Christians little they're gonna send eighty SA I don't have to sit there in the school setting and so on and and have to participate or even watch as everyone stands around me and says the pledge which mentions god or says a prayer after some function at school but but the constitution doesn't give you a heckler's veto you don't have the right no one forces you to participate in anything you have the right not to participate but you don't have the right to silence everybody else and and thanks for the memory of Christians and Jews and Muslims and atheists every one of us we have the right to seek out and worship god of to live according to our own faith in conscious it that's religious faith you have the right to live according to that if you're an atheist you have the right to live according to that and the you know the amazing thing is the left loves to preach tolerance and diversity terror is nothing so intolerant as a leftist who says don't you Sir dare say Jesus around me I will not tolerate the name of Jesus you

exactly did this happen you're right it is simply the function you know Google admitted in its own statement that you know user I. engagement was very very low is is this is something we as consumers all know we probably download Google plus for a hot minute several years ago and have never gone back to it but what happened is you know the profiles of men hot of hundreds of thousands of people are still on Google plus of course and this specific API allowed a developer to request a view of certain pieces of user information so this would have included here name your email address there wasn't sort of private messages that were sent between users that's not expose according to Google but some of that sort of basic identifying information was just sort of out there and open for any developers who had access to this API and and figure this out to request it so what can you tell us a little bit about the time line in terms of when they realize this and when they decided at least is reporting goes not to share with the public so we all know that obviously there's been the sort of fire storm of interest in privacy data security at the big tech companies over the last year or two years especially when it comes to Facebook and so in January of this year January twenty eighteen Google internally decided to do a major security and data privacy review of all its products they want to make sure that this exact kind of thing wasn't out there unbeknownst to them and this is something that they found in March twenty eighteen so this was right when Facebook was bearing the brunt of the Cambridge analytica scandal right around the time that mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to explain his company's actions and internally Google decided not to put that out there that's something that they've admitted that they found in March twenty eighteen decided at the time that they didn't feel it was necessary to tell the public the Wall Street journal is reporting citing their sources that Google made that decision because of the political pressure that they'd seen out in the space at the time so how will this ratchet up the political pressure mean Google I has already been smarting for not sending someone to testify a few weeks ago when Sheryl Sandberg the CO a Facebook and Jack Dorsey the CEO of Twitter went to testify he is now scheduled to testify before Congress at some point in the coming weeks how do you expect lawmakers will take to this I mean lawmakers are gonna jump on this just like they've jumped on on every issue that not just Google but other tech companies have sort of had over the past couple years Google has been getting a lot of attention last couple months before that they had although had to face some criticism they've been kind of able to skate above the worst of it that had been reserved for Facebook and Twitter but now they're really at the center of it the president tweeted about a month and a half ago that Facebook you know it sorry that Google was only showing negative news about his presidency was very upset about that conservative politicians have said that Google has a liberal bias that they are suppressing liberal opinions on Google news in on you tube and that they want that to change of course there's no evidence that this is happening Google continues to push back against it but it doesn't seem to be going away Google is continuing to be you know a topic that politicians like to talk about and as we head into the mid terms such on the Republican side it seems that this company Facebook as well Twitter's while but Google's right in the in sort of the focus right now is a way for them to get their voters out so they're sending messages to their voters to their conservative voters that you know Google is a big bad technology company from California that isn't respectful of your privacy and is trying to shape the country towards a more liberal position and this is something that seems to be gaining traction with some voters it doesn't look like it's an issue that's going to go away for Google what exactly do we know about the date as in our precise testimony in the substance of it

printers potentially more forest fires but all the things that we're seeing in terms of a climate flooding drought you're saying you're just going to get more of that and that it could in fact you know of impact the future of our planet for future generations but now you're saying is the time to act and of course it's not just governments that need to take steps we're also hearing that individuals can help so what are some things that people can do well there's certainly not taking the pressure off the government's they're saying those are that's where we have to have the leadership from in team in terms of things like remember we talked a lot about emission capture technology they say that there's been no investment in that that's still on tried to all of that has to happen but what they're saying is that things are so bad that they do need a really bought broad spectrum of effort from individuals like you and me all the way up to government to the oil to the private sector and that there are acts that we as consumers can be taking and making to put pressure on the government so were electric cars that will help reach you know renewable energy sustainability sustainable renew renewable energy targets down the road what about eating meat because the livestock industry is a big you know greenhouse gas emission producer they're saying we need to be thinking about these kinds of things as a society as we go forward but they are also saying that the other thing that you can do is pressure your governments to take these warnings from scientist seriously and as you know we have the US president Donald Trump who is saying he's going to be taking the United States out of the Paris accord that's led to a great deal of criticism as this report comes out we saw the former U.

it hit communities in got now on the Quebec side of the provincial border carving a path of destruction all along the way now around two hundred thousand customers are still without power in the Ottawa area many are staying in local shelters the CBC's auto bureau chief robbers so is in one of the hardest hit neighborhoods we're going to take you down green bank road this is one of the main thoroughfares in suburban opinion one of the biggest suburbs of water while we're gonna start over my right shoulder right here we've got at least four or five of these telephone poles that have been effectively been snapped in half other leaning down like old gentleman is what they look like tired old gentleman but that means there's no power anywhere in this area we're going to not pan over my

on the right edge of the roof of an Audi automobile I think that might be one of the luckiest drivers alive in auto what today where were you when the storm hit I was inside of my house I was looking through the window and when when I heard the sound of the tone and I just ran into my basement just stay safe and thank god nothing happened to my street but a lot of the streets near it was completely destroyed this is as I said one of the most important thoroughfares in suburban auto walk it goes on for at least a half a kilometer that means traffic's going to be a mass that means kids

actually looks like it may have started out as far as Kilbowie and we actually been doing damage I'm doing damage service of running through trying to see the whole thing and try to figure out exactly where the damage was so I have seen damage off to the west there is house a taken out and a essentially a barn completely removed from the foundations so quite a bit of damage what we're seeing behind me here is what looked to be of some of the strongest parts of the tornado of also been the to the excuse me to the east over by the river and that area get anything major trees down so this looks like right here where one of the strongest parts of the storm hit and this was just because of the way and that we had a flood business as we had a fall storm with summer heat and moisture mix those two together and you get the ingredients for a very powerful tornado and this is a result of that Natasha the weather network's mark Robinson in done robin Ontario thank you the storm had a

decided to ride out the storm in the boats of people I talk to are going to stay in the boat by the people who live in their boats and they I just under the impression that they would rather be there maintain the problems as a storm was rolling in that come and deal with them later particularly because this is where they live there's a science to maintaining the lines with the boats are more of an art really what you want to do is make sure that there's enough slack in the lines so as the water comes up you don't pull the boat away from the dock itself but you want to have the lines tight enough that you don't thrash around and bang into the other boats and that's the kind of thing that the people want to maintain out here that being said a lot of people think that again the worst of the storm is going to be further to the east they're fairly optimistic people did wake up to the news this morning that it was it had upgraded to a category four storm so we did see things like people in this area boarding up this morning so a little better late than never so to answer your question where people ready they think there is ready as they need to be a lot of optimism this far western

so the water should be pretty low the edge of this boat should be about parallel with this doc and this is a good example because this is one of those floating docks it's a fixed docks so is the water level comes up so the water level should be very low right now this boat should be about parallel with the top of the dock so we've got a lot of water that's already come in with the yell in the

atmospheric gas it's a plant nutrients are you aware of anything that is happening in the oceans that relates to fossil fuel emissions there are probably a number of them and I miss you very superficial understanding I particularly was concerned about an article you wrote the article was signing the Paris agreement is the worst way to celebrate Earth Day of the additional heat that has been captured in the atmosphere as a result of greenhouse gas emissions to know how much of that accident about that has been captured in the ocean is it more or less than fifty percent do you even know that no no okay but I believe there are different opinions on that but there's no one right answer really do you think there's actual serious difference of opinion whether it's below fifty percent yes you think there is there is different opinions as to how much of that has been captured by the ocean you think there's serious scientific opinion that it's below fifty percent yes okay

to adopt more somewhat similar to those that have been adopted by the Europeans look who's here Alan Patricof now he's co founder of great crofter but his big deal is is one of the original investors in apple back in nineteen seventy nine and you you're a tech investor way back man correct yes Sir but you want to rein him in and we get you get you want to make them liable I believe for mistakes with the data that they collect is that right I think you push me a little too far what I'm what I basically have said and what I've been briefed reacting to what the lose of yesterday and the four is G. D. P. R. which is been instituted Europe is a pot has been positively accepted by the industry broadly everyone is has adopted G. P. R. principles so they're obviously been living with it G. P. R.'s almost a year now I think that the Europeans will find them a ton of money if they didn't make a mistake in the data gets out all the crushing some small company old old the American companies that are on our wall operating over there and they're all operating under those rules so I I my basic impression is that those rules have been accepted by the industry and I think that people are generally concerned today with their privacy I mean I had which conversation yesterday with a roll of mine said he turns off the the video and make sure it's his computers off at night and make sure that the they lex's off he had no everyone is very nervous about where data is being collected but they're getting it from places follow people cover the cameras on the phones all the time I do that the my point so they did but if we adopted Europe's rules if we don't do them here with that radically change the business model of the Facebook single wasn't quite as of this well I I think there's a little bit over reaction from your comments of what the prices of done research and just this morning I think that it's a fact of life privacy is front and center they're going to have to be rules and you're gonna have to live by the rules and I I think so far the GDP our rules the companies we dealt with all seem to be adapting to it and are willing to live with it so I I I mean I say that's guide
